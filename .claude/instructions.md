# Project Instructions: Evidence-Based Parenting Platform

## Brand Authority Context
This platform is authored by a **Pediatric Nurse Practitioner specializing in developmental and neurological care** at a premier research hospital. You are assisting with content and features for a clinical resource—NOT a lifestyle blog or parent-to-parent community.

## Core Decision-Making Mandate

**Always reference the brand strategy when making decisions about:**
- Content writing (blog posts, guides, quick help)
- UI copy (buttons, navigation, microcopy, error messages)
- Visual design (colors, typography, spacing, components)
- Feature planning (ensuring alignment with brand values and positioning)

**Full brand strategy:** See `.claude/docs/brand-strategy.md`
**Quick reference:** See `BRAND.md` at project root

## Non-Negotiable Brand Guardrails

### 1. Clinical Authority Over Folksy Appeal
- **Always** write from the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner / Clinical perspective
- **Never** adopt a "parent-to-parent," "mom-to-mom," or conversational lifestyle tone
- **Never** use phrases like "trust your gut," "mama bear instinct," or "mom guilt"
- Frame parental knowledge as essential for **customizing and implementing** the scientific baseline, not as the source of truth itself

### 2. Evidence-Based Foundation
- Ground advice in clinical research (aim for 80% research, 20% applied experience)
- Prioritize objective, measurable outcomes over subjective validation
- Cite developmental science, neurology, and pediatric research when relevant

### 3. The Perseverance Technique (Effort-to-Outcome Frame)
When delivering difficult advice (Candor), **always pair** short-term difficulty with specific long-term developmental dividends.

**Example:**
✗ "Sleep training can be hard, but hang in there!"
✓ "Consistent sleep protocols require 5-7 nights of increased crying (short-term effort), but establish self-soothing neural pathways that support emotional regulation and independent sleep for years (long-term developmental dividend)."

### 4. Reframed Parental Intuition
- **Avoid:** Emotional validation of subjective experience
- **Use:** Position the parent as the expert implementer who customizes the evidence-based baseline to their specific child
- The brand provides the roadmap; the parent is the guide

### 5. Tone by Content Type

**Quick Help** (urgent, high-stress moments):
- Direct, imperative, concise
- Numbered steps immediately scannable
- No preamble or emotional cushioning
- Optimized for triage and immediate action

**Guides** (protocol implementation, building understanding):
- Educating, measured, explanatory
- Provide context and "why" to foster perseverance
- Include actionable checklists and protocols
- Support long-term consistency

## Visual Identity Guardrails

**Color Palette:**
- Base: White, Deep Navy, Charcoal
- Goal: Cool, tonal, subdued—projects Calm and Clinical rigor
- Avoid: Bright pastels, playful colors, overly warm tones

**Typography:**
- Body: Clean, robust Sans-Serif (high readability)
- Headings: Sophisticated Serif (reinforces rigor and authority)

**Layout:**
- Strict grid-based, minimalist design
- High white space to reduce cognitive load
- Quick Help: Distinct visual header, no sidebars
- Guides: Table of contents, progress bars, downloadable checklists

## Content Pillars
All content should align with one of these three strategic pillars:
1. **Foundational Sleep & Soothing** (neurological regulation, self-soothing mechanics)
2. **Sensory Integration & Environmental Design** (optimal developmental environments, managing modern stimuli)
3. **Nutrition, Motor & Language Pathways** (physical inputs, sequential milestones, brain architecture)

## Success Metric to Keep in Mind
**Perseverance Success Metric:** Track protocol downloads AND return visits within 7-14 days. This indicates users are actively implementing high-effort, multi-step advice despite short-term difficulty—the core brand promise in action.

When in doubt, choose **Clinical Authority** over **Relatability**, **Objectivity** over **Validation**, and **Long-term Development** over **Short-term Ease**.
