## ⚠️ Call 911 or Go to ER Immediately If:

- Rhythmic jerking movements lasting more than 2-3 minutes (if unsure whether it's a seizure) OR more than 5 minutes (if clearly a seizure)
- Your baby becomes unresponsive and won't wake up
- Your baby's lips or face turn blue during an episode
- Multiple episodes of concerning movements in a short time
- First suspected seizure, regardless of duration or resolution, especially in a newborn (0-28 days).
- Difficulty breathing during or after the episode

## 🚨 Call Your Pediatrician Urgently (Same Day) If:

- Brief episode of rhythmic jerking or stiffening that resolved
- Unusual eye movements with staring spells
- Repeated episodes of concerning movements
- Any episode you're worried might have been a seizure
- Your baby seems different after the episode

**Important:** When in doubt, seek immediate medical attention. It's always better to have a benign movement evaluated than to miss a seizure.

## Quick Differentiation Checklist

### Signs MORE LIKELY Normal:

□ **Movement stops when you touch or reposition baby**
Seizures typically don't stop with touch or movement

□ **Baby remains awake and alert throughout**
Most seizures involve altered awareness

□ **Movements are variable and not rhythmic**
Seizures usually have repetitive, rhythmic quality (though subtle neonatal seizures can be non-rhythmic)

□ **Only happens during sleep transitions**
Benign sleep myoclonus is common

□ **Happens during feeding or when drowsy**
Many benign movements cluster around state transitions

□ **Baby can be consoled or distracted**
Seizure activity doesn't respond to soothing

□ **No changes in breathing or color**
Seizures may affect breathing and cause color changes

### Signs MORE LIKELY Concerning:

□ **Rhythmic, repetitive movements (same motion over and over)**

□ **Baby becomes unresponsive or has altered awareness**

□ **Eyes deviate to one side or have unusual rolling movements**

□ **Stiffening of body or limbs**

□ **Jerking that progresses or changes**

□ **Color changes (pale, blue, or flushed)**

□ **Changes in breathing**

□ **Followed by extreme sleepiness or confusion**

## What's Happening

As a pediatric neurology NP, I evaluate concerning movements in babies frequently. Here's what parents need to understand: **Most unusual movements in babies are NOT seizures.** Babies have many normal but startling movements that can look frightening to parents. **Although seizures in infants are real, they are far less common than normal developmental movements that can mimic them.**

However, seizures do occur in infants, and recognizing the difference matters. True seizures require medical evaluation and treatment, while normal movements just need reassurance.

**The challenge:** Infant seizures can look different from what many people imagine. They're not always the dramatic "grand mal" seizures portrayed in media. Some infant seizures are subtle, which is why video recording and medical evaluation are so important.

## NORMAL Movements That Commonly Worry Parents

### Benign Sleep Myoclonus (Very Common)

**What it looks like:**

- Brief jerks or twitches during sleep
- Often involves arms, legs, or whole body
- Happens only when baby is asleep
- Stops immediately when baby wakes
- May be triggered or worsened by stimuli (sound, light touch)—this is reassuring, not concerning

**Why it happens:** Normal immature nervous system activity during sleep. Very common in newborns and young infants. EEG is normal during these movements, and they stop during REM-to-wake transitions.

**Key differentiator:** **Stops completely when you wake the baby.** If you can wake your baby and the movements stop, it's not a seizure.

**When it resolves:** Usually by 3-6 months, sometimes persists longer

---

### Startle Reflex (Moro Reflex)

**What it looks like:**

- Sudden "startled" response with arms flinging out
- Often triggered by loud noise, sudden movement, or feeling of falling
- Brief, single event
- Baby typically cries after

**Why it happens:** Normal primitive reflex present from birth

**Key differentiator:** Clear trigger, single occurrence, not rhythmic or repetitive

**When it resolves:** Typically by 4-6 months

**Note:** Exaggerated Moro reflex (very pronounced or occurring with minimal stimulation) may occur in some neurologic conditions, but typical startle pattern is benign.

---

### Jitteriness or Tremors

**What it looks like:**

- Fine, rapid shaking movements
- Often affects hands or chin
- Occurs when baby is awake, especially when crying or cold
- Stops when you gently hold or flex the affected area

**Why it happens:** Immature nervous system regulation, sometimes low blood sugar (primarily an issue in first 48-72 hours unless other metabolic concerns)

**Key differentiator:** **Stops with gentle restraint.** If you gently hold the shaking limb, true jitteriness stops. Seizures don't. Jitteriness never occurs with eye deviation or autonomic changes (color changes, apnea, sweating), unlike seizures.

**When concerning:** Persistent jitteriness after the first few days of life should be evaluated

---

### Shuddering Attacks

**What it looks like:**

- Rapid shivering or shuddering of head and upper body
- Lasts just a few seconds
- Baby remains fully alert and aware
- No loss of consciousness
- Do not occur during sleep

**Why it happens:** Benign movement disorder, cause unknown but not harmful

**Key differentiator:** Very brief (seconds), baby is completely normal before, during, and after

**When it resolves:** Usually by age 2-3 years

---

### Chin Quivering

**What it looks like:**

- Rapid trembling of the chin
- Often when baby is crying or upset
- Baby is otherwise normal

**Why it happens:** Normal phenomenon in young infants

**Key differentiator:** Isolated to chin, doesn't involve other body parts or altered awareness. Not a seizure unless associated with other body parts or changes in consciousness.

**When it resolves:** Usually in first few months

### Benign Paroxysmal Torticollis (Rare)

> **What it looks like:** Sudden, repeated episodes where the baby's head tilts severely to one side, sometimes with arching or vomiting. The baby is usually alert and happy otherwise. Episodes can last minutes to hours.
>
> **Key Differentiator:** The movement is not rhythmic jerking; it is primarily a _posture_ (tilting/twisting), and the baby is completely normal between episodes. Always requires medical workup to rule out other causes.

## What Actual Seizures Look Like in Babies

Seizures in infants can present in many ways. Here are the most common types:

### Focal Seizures (Partial Seizures)

**What they look like:**

- Rhythmic jerking of one arm or leg
- Twitching on one side of face
- Eyes deviating to one side
- May or may not involve loss of awareness
- Can last seconds to minutes

**Key features:** Rhythmic, repetitive, typically involving one part of body

---

### Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

**What they look like:**

- Body stiffening (tonic phase)
- Followed by rhythmic jerking of arms and legs (clonic phase)
- Loss of consciousness
- May have color changes, breathing changes
- Followed by sleepiness

**Key features:** Most recognizable type, involves whole body

---

### Infantile Spasms (Medical Emergency)

**What they look like:**

- Sudden stiffening and bending forward (like a "jack-knife")
- Arms may fling out
- Occur in clusters (multiple spasms in a row)
- Often happen when waking up or falling asleep
- Each spasm lasts 1-2 seconds
- May have 5-50 spasms in a cluster

**Age:** Can begin as early as 2-3 months, peaking at 4-8 months (though often missed early on). While less common in the first 2 months, parents should be aware of this pattern.

**Key features:** Cluster of brief spasms, often with developmental regression or loss of previously gained skills

**Red flags:**

- Developmental regression or loss of previously gained skills
- Cluster pattern (spasms occurring in groups)
- Consistent timing (often when waking or falling asleep)

**CRITICAL:** Infantile spasms require urgent evaluation and treatment. If you suspect this, call your pediatrician immediately.

---

### Subtle Seizures (Common in Newborns)

**What they look like:**

- Staring with eye deviation
- Unusual tongue movements, chewing, lip smacking
- Bicycling movements of legs
- Brief pauses in breathing
- Unusual eye movements

**Key features:** Can be very subtle and hard to recognize. Not suppressible with gentle touch (unlike jitteriness).

**Crucial Note:** "These are the most common type of seizure in babies under 1 month but are often missed because they are so subtle."

## How to Tell the Difference: Key Questions

**Clinical Insight:**
When evaluating a concerning movement, I start with three critical questions: First, "Could you interrupt it?"—if touch, repositioning, or waking stops the movement, it's almost never a seizure. Second, "Describe exactly what you saw"—I listen for rhythmic repetition, eye deviation, or color changes that suggest seizure activity. Third, "How was your baby afterward?"—immediate return to baseline points toward normal movements, while prolonged sleepiness or confusion suggests seizure. The single most helpful tool is video—even 10 seconds of footage gives me more information than any verbal description. I also ask about timing patterns (clustered episodes raise concern), whether movements are suppressible with gentle restraint (jitteriness stops, seizures don't), and whether there were autonomic signs like apnea or skin color changes. Parents often know something is "different"—I take that instinct seriously and evaluate thoroughly rather than dismiss concerns.

When trying to determine if a movement is a seizure, I look for:

**1. Can you interrupt the movement?**

- Normal movements: Usually stop with touch, repositioning, or waking
- Seizures: Continue despite intervention

**2. Is the movement rhythmic and repetitive?**

- Normal movements: Variable, irregular
- Seizures: Often rhythmic, same pattern repeating

**3. What is baby's awareness level?**

- Normal movements: Baby is alert or normally asleep
- Seizures: Often altered awareness, staring, unresponsive

**4. How long does it last?**

- Normal movements: Usually seconds
- Seizures: Can last seconds to minutes

**5. What happens after?**

- Normal movements: Baby is immediately normal
- Seizures: May have prolonged sleepiness or confusion

**6. Is there autonomic involvement?**

- Normal movements: No color changes, breathing remains normal
- Seizures: May have color changes (pale, blue, flushed), apnea, or sweating

**7. Is there a pattern?**

- Normal movements: Random occurrence
- Seizures: May occur in clusters or at specific times

## What to Do If You Witness a Concerning Episode

### During the Episode:

1. **Keep your baby safe**

   - Place on safe surface (not elevated)
   - Turn to side if possible
   - Don't restrain movements
   - Don't put anything in baby's mouth

2. **Note the time**

   - Check when it starts
   - Time how long it lasts
   - Timing helps medical evaluation

3. **Observe carefully**

   - What body parts are involved?
   - What type of movement (jerking, stiffening, etc.)?
   - Are the movements synchronous (both sides moving together rhythmically) or asynchronous?
   - Is baby responsive?
   - Any color changes?
   - Changes in breathing?

4. **Video if possible**
   - The SINGLE most helpful thing for diagnosis
   - Even a few seconds of video helps tremendously
   - Don't delay safety to get video, but if someone else is present, have them record

### After the Episode:

1. **Assess your baby**

   - Are they breathing normally?
   - Are they responsive?
   - Have they returned to baseline?

2. **Seek appropriate care**

   - Call 911 if: Episode lasted >2-3 minutes (if unsure it's a seizure) or >5 minutes (if clearly a seizure), baby not breathing normally, baby won't wake up, this is a first suspected seizure
   - Call pediatrician urgently if: Brief episode that resolved, baby seems back to normal
   - Go to ER if: You're very concerned even if episode resolved

3. **Document details**
   - Write down exactly what happened
   - Note time, duration, what you observed
   - Save any videos

## When to Seek Immediate Evaluation

**Call 911 or go to ER immediately for:**

- Any suspected seizure lasting more than 5 minutes (or >2-3 minutes if you're unsure whether it's a seizure—seizures in infants can be hard to identify and prolonged episodes escalate quickly)
- Multiple seizures without regaining consciousness between them
- First suspected seizure (even if brief)
- Seizure with difficulty breathing or blue color
- Baby won't wake up after episode
- Seizure with high fever in baby under 6 months

**Call pediatrician same day for:**

- Brief episode (under 1 minute) that could have been a seizure
- Repeated episodes of concerning movements
- Any episode you can't clearly identify as normal
- Movements that worry you even if baby seems fine

**Video is invaluable:** If safe to do so, video any concerning episode. This helps healthcare providers tremendously in determining what happened.

## Febrile Seizures: A Special Category

Febrile seizures (seizures with fever) deserve brief mention:

**What they are:** Seizures triggered by fever, often early in an illness, occurring in 2-5% of children

**Age:** Typically 6 months to 5 years

**What they look like:** Usually generalized tonic-clonic (stiffening, then rhythmic jerking)

**What to do:**

- Seek immediate medical attention for first febrile seizure
- Call 911 if seizure lasts more than 5 minutes
- Place baby in safe position, don't restrain

**Prognosis:** Usually benign, most children outgrow them, small risk of recurrence

**Note:** **Seizure with fever in baby under 6 months requires urgent evaluation (may indicate serious infection, not simple febrile seizure)**

---

## Why Accurate Diagnosis Matters

**If movements are normal:**

- Reassurance for parents
- Avoid unnecessary testing or medication
- Understanding of normal infant development

**If movements are seizures:**

- Appropriate treatment to control seizures
- Investigation of underlying cause
- Monitoring for developmental impact
- Family education and support

**Clinical Insight:**
When I evaluate a baby for possible seizures, I start with a detailed history and neurologic exam. If I'm concerned about seizure activity, I order an EEG (electroencephalogram)—this measures brain electrical activity and can detect seizures or abnormal patterns. For urgent situations (like suspected infantile spasms or frequent events), I arrange same-day or next-day EEG. For less urgent concerns, outpatient EEG within 1-2 weeks is typical. I consider brain MRI when there are focal findings on exam, abnormal EEG, or concerning history. Labs depend on presentation: I check glucose and electrolytes for newborns, metabolic screening if there's concern for inborn errors of metabolism, and sometimes genetic testing. Most importantly, video of the episodes—even brief clips—dramatically improves diagnostic accuracy. Many times, watching parent-recorded video immediately reassures me that movements are benign, sparing the family from unnecessary testing. The evaluation is tailored to each baby's specific presentation rather than following a one-size-fits-all protocol.
