## Emergency Preparedness Protocol

### Basic Seizure Response Steps

**⚠️ For detailed step-by-step emergency guidance:** [Seizure Emergency Response Guide](/quick-help/seizure-emergency)

**Quick reference:** Stay calm, time the seizure, place baby on side, protect from injury, observe movements, and call 911 if seizure exceeds 5 minutes or meets other emergency criteria below.

### When to Call 911

**Call 911 immediately if:**

- [ ] Seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes
- [ ] Multiple seizures without regaining consciousness between
- [ ] First seizure ever
- [ ] Difficulty breathing or turning blue
- [ ] Seizure in water
- [ ] Seizure with injury
- [ ] Baby won't wake up after seizure
- [ ] Any concern this is a medical emergency

### When to Use Rescue Medication

**If your neurologist has prescribed rescue medication:**

**Use when:**

1. Seizure lasting longer than prescribed duration (typically 3-5 minutes, per your specific instructions)
2. Cluster seizures as defined by your neurology team
3. Any other specific scenarios outlined in your seizure action plan

**After administering rescue medication:**

1. Call 911 if this is first time using rescue medication
2. Call 911 if seizure doesn't stop within 5 minutes of administration
3. Call 911 if there are any breathing difficulties or skin color change
4. Follow your specific seizure action plan
5. Document medication given, time, and dose
6. Contact neurology team after seizure resolves

**Do NOT use rescue medication:**

- For typical brief seizures that self-resolve
- More frequently than prescribed
- Without proper training on administration

### When to Contact Neurologist (Non-Emergency)

**Call neurology office same day or next business day if:**

- Seizure occurred but resolved, baby back to baseline
- Seizure was longer or different than usual pattern
- Cluster of seizures (multiple in short period) but baby recovered
- Concerns about medication side effects
- Questions about seizure action plan

### Emergency Contact Information

**Create a one-page seizure action plan** with your baby's name, diagnosis, neurologist/pediatrician contacts, rescue medication details (if prescribed), and when to call 911. Keep copies on your refrigerator, in diaper bag, and with all caregivers. Many neurology offices provide standardized templates.

## Safety Protocols by Environment

### Sleep Safety

**Nighttime protocols:**

1. **Safe sleep environment:**

   - Firm, flat mattress
   - No loose bedding, pillows, or toys in crib
   - Follow AAP safe sleep guidelines
   - Room-sharing recommended (baby in own crib in parents' room)

2. **Monitoring:**

   - Video baby monitor with sound
   - Consider monitoring baby's position and breathing patterns
   - Some families use seizure detection devices (discuss with neurologist)
   - Check on baby periodically

3. **Positioning:**

   - Place on back to sleep (AAP recommendation)
   - If seizure occurs during sleep, baby may end up in different position
   - Ensure crib is free of objects that could obstruct breathing

4. **Response plan:**
   - Know how to respond if nighttime seizure occurs
   - Keep rescue medication (if prescribed) accessible
   - Have phone charged and nearby

**Nap safety:**

- Same protocols as nighttime sleep
- Maintain visual or monitor supervision

### Bath Time Protocol

**CRITICAL: Never leave baby alone in bath.** Use minimal water (2-3 inches), maintain constant hand contact, and keep baths brief (5-10 minutes). If seizure occurs, support head to keep face out of water, lift baby out when safe, and call 911. Consider sponge baths as alternative.

### Play and Floor Time Safety

**Safe play environment:** Use soft floor surfaces (carpet, foam mats), maintain visual contact, pad furniture corners, and avoid baby walkers. Ensure safety straps on all equipment (high chairs, bouncers, swings) and stay present when baby is in elevated positions.

### Feeding Safety

**Never leave baby alone during feeding.** Hold securely during bottle/breast feeding; if seizure occurs, remove bottle immediately and position to prevent aspiration. For solid foods (6+ months), use appropriate textures, avoid choking hazards, keep baby upright in high chair with safety restraints, and stay within arm's reach.

### Car Seat and Travel Safety

**Proper car seat installation** (rear-facing, tight, age-appropriate) with secure harness straps. Use mirror or camera to monitor baby during travel. **If seizure occurs while driving:** pull over immediately, put car in park, move to back seat, and call 911 if needed. Don't resume driving until baby has recovered.

**Travel checklist:** Extra medication, seizure action plan, neurologist contacts, medical records, and nearest hospital locations at destination.

### Developmental Stage Adaptations

**As baby grows, update safety protocols:**

**Rolling (4-6 months):**

- Increased fall risk
- Never leave on elevated surface
- Expand safe floor space

**Sitting (6-9 months):**

- Cushioned area for inevitable tumbles
- Remove hard objects from vicinity
- Supervised sitting practice

**Crawling (7-10 months):**

- Expand baby-proofed area
- Gate off stairs
- Remove access to hazardous areas

**Pulling to stand (9-12 months):**

- Pad hard furniture edges
- Secure furniture to walls
- Remove climbing hazards
- Cushioned floor surfaces in standing practice areas

**Cruising and walking (10-15 months):**

- Helmet consideration (discuss with neurologist if frequent falls during seizures)
- Continued environmental padding
- Stair gates top and bottom
- Constant supervision in new skill practice

## Seizure Monitoring and Documentation Protocol

### What to Document

**For every seizure, record:**

1. **Date and time:**

   - Exact start time
   - Duration (use timer or clock)
   - Time to return to baseline

2. **Seizure characteristics:**

   - Type of movements (jerking, stiffening, limp)
   - Body parts involved (one side, both sides, specific limbs)
   - Eye position (straight ahead, deviated, rolling, closed)
   - Level of awareness (responsive, unresponsive, partially aware)
   - Color changes (pale, blue, flushed)

3. **Before the seizure:**

   - Activity baby was doing
   - Possible triggers (missed sleep, illness, missed medication, fever)
   - Any warning signs or changes in behavior
   - Time since last medication dose

4. **After the seizure:**

   - Postictal state (sleepy, confused, weak)
   - Duration of recovery period
   - Any focal weakness or abnormal movements
   - Return to normal behavior

5. **Interventions:**
   - Rescue medication given (time, dose)
   - Emergency services called
   - Other actions taken

### Video Documentation

**How to video effectively:**

1. **If safe to do so:**

   - Do not prioritize video over baby's safety
   - Have second person video if possible
   - Keep phone charged and accessible

2. **What to capture:**

   - Start video as early in seizure as possible
   - Film face and body
   - Capture entire seizure from start to finish if possible
   - Continue briefly into postictal period
   - Speak date and time onto video

3. **Video is valuable because:**

   - Shows neurologist exact seizure characteristics
   - Captures details you may not remember
   - Helps differentiate seizure types
   - Tracks changes in seizure pattern over time

4. **Storage and sharing:**
   - Save videos in organized folder (dated)
   - Upload to secure cloud storage
   - Share with neurology team (via patient portal or as directed)

### Seizure Diary or Log

**Tracking methods:**

**Option 1: Paper log**

- Notebook or printed template
- Keep in accessible location
- Bring to all neurology appointments

**Option 2: Digital log**

- Seizure tracking apps
- Spreadsheet
- Notes app with date stamps

**Option 3: Calendar**

- Mark each seizure on calendar
- Note duration and characteristics

**Information to track over time:**

- [ ] Seizure frequency (daily, weekly, monthly patterns)
- [ ] Seizure duration trends
- [ ] Time of day patterns
- [ ] Potential triggers identified
- [ ] Medication changes correlation
- [ ] Illness correlation
- [ ] Sleep pattern correlation
- [ ] Developmental changes correlation

### Pattern Recognition

**Watch for patterns that may indicate:**

**Seizure triggers:**

- Time of day (morning, night, during sleep transitions)
- Sleep deprivation
- Illness or fever
- Missed medications
- Specific activities

**Changes requiring medical attention:**

- Increasing seizure frequency
- Longer seizure duration
- New seizure types
- Clustering (multiple seizures close together)
- Incomplete recovery between seizures

**Share patterns with neurology team:**

- Bring seizure log to every appointment
- Report significant pattern changes promptly
- Discuss potential trigger management

## Seizure Recognition Protocol

### Differentiating Seizures from Normal Movements

**For in-depth guidance on distinguishing seizures from normal infant movements:** [Seizure vs. Normal Movements Guide](/guides/health/seizure-vs-normal-movements)

**Common normal movements often mistaken for seizures:**

**Benign sleep myoclonus** - Jerking only during sleep that stops when baby wakes, no eye involvement

**Jitteriness** - Fine trembling that stops when you gently hold the limb, often triggered by handling

**Startle reflex** - Brief arm flinging triggered by noise/position change, baby remains aware and responsive

### Seizure Characteristics Checklist

**More likely to be a seizure if:**

- [ ] Rhythmic, repetitive movements
- [ ] Doesn't stop when you touch or hold limb
- [ ] Eyes open with fixed gaze or deviation
- [ ] Baby is unresponsive or altered awareness
- [ ] Progresses or changes during episode
- [ ] Followed by period of sleepiness or confusion (postictal)
- [ ] Consistent pattern each time it happens
- [ ] Lasts longer than a few seconds
- [ ] Color change (pale, blue, flushed)
- [ ] Breathing changes

**More likely to be normal if:**

- [ ] Only during sleep or drowsiness
- [ ] Stops with gentle touch or repositioning
- [ ] Baby is awake and aware throughout
- [ ] Not rhythmic or stereotyped
- [ ] Very brief (1-2 seconds)
- [ ] Triggered by obvious external stimulus
- [ ] Inconsistent pattern

### Know Your Baby's Seizure Pattern

**If your baby has diagnosed epilepsy:**

1. **Learn the typical characteristics:**

   - How seizures usually start
   - Typical duration
   - Usual body parts involved
   - Expected postictal behavior

2. **Recognize variations:**

   - New seizure types may emerge
   - Seizures may change as baby grows
   - Report new or different seizure types to neurologist

3. **Identify concerning changes:**
   - Longer duration than usual
   - More frequent than usual
   - Different pattern or body parts involved
   - Incomplete recovery between seizures
   - New symptoms

### When in Doubt

**If you're unsure whether an event was a seizure:**

1. **Video the event if it happens again**
2. **Document detailed description**
3. **Call neurology office for guidance**
4. **Share video with medical team**

**Do not dismiss concerning movements** - Better to check with medical team than miss seizure activity requiring treatment adjustment.

## Care Coordination Protocol

### Medical Team Communication

**Your baby's medical team may include:**

- Primary pediatrician
- Pediatric neurologist
- Neurology nurse practitioner or physician assistant
- EEG technicians
- Pharmacist
- Other specialists as needed

**Establish clear communication:**

1. **Designate primary contact** (usually neurologist for seizure-related questions)

2. **Know how to reach team:**

   - Office number
   - After-hours number
   - Patient portal access
   - When to call vs. message vs. go to ER

3. **Prepare for appointments:**

   - Bring seizure log
   - Bring medication list
   - Bring videos if new seizures or changes
   - Write questions in advance
   - Bring support person for note-taking

4. **Share information between providers:**
   - Ensure pediatrician has neurology notes
   - Inform all providers of medication changes
   - Coordinate care for other medical issues

### Caregiver Education and Action Plan

**Create and distribute a written seizure action plan** with baby's diagnosis, medication schedule, typical seizure description, rescue medication instructions (if applicable), when to call 911, and emergency contacts. Share with all caregivers, daycare providers, and anyone supervising baby. Keep copies on refrigerator, in diaper bag, at daycare, and on phone.

**Train all caregivers by:** reviewing the action plan together, showing seizure videos (if available/comfortable), demonstrating rescue medication technique (if applicable), and practicing emergency response scenarios.

**Educate family members** with age-appropriate explanations. For siblings: simple explanations of condition, what to do if seizure occurs, reassurance it's not their fault. For extended family: share information as comfortable and provide action plan if they spend time with baby.

   - Midday (if needed): With lunch or specific activity

2. **Prepare medication station:**

   - Designated drawer or cabinet
   - All supplies together (medication, syringes, log)
   - Good lighting
   - Clean surface

3. **Backup plans:**
   - Medication in diaper bag for outings
   - Alarms on phone
   - Partner knows schedule if you're unavailable

**Sleep schedule:**

1. **Consistent sleep/wake times:**

   - Regular bedtime and wake time
   - Appropriate naps for age
   - Sleep deprivation can trigger seizures in some babies

2. **Bedtime routine:**
   - Calming, predictable sequence
   - Include evening medication if applicable
   - Safe sleep environment check

**Feeding schedule:**

1. **Regular meal times:**

   - Appropriate for baby's age
   - Coordinate with medication timing
   - Note any dietary restrictions (ketogenic diet if prescribed)

2. **Special diet management** (if applicable):
   - Ketogenic diet requires precise implementation
   - Work with nutritionist
   - Careful measurement and documentation

### Developmental Support

**Continue age-appropriate activities:**

1. **Motor development:**

   - Tummy time (supervised)
   - Reaching and grasping practice
   - Sitting, crawling, standing practice
   - Safe environment for skill development

2. **Language and social development:**

   - Face-to-face interaction
   - Reading and singing
   - Serve-and-return exchanges
   - Social play

3. **Cognitive development:**
   - Age-appropriate toys and activities
   - Exploration and discovery
   - Problem-solving opportunities

**Monitor developmental progress:**

- Attend all well-child visits
- Track milestones
- Report concerns to pediatrician and neurologist
- Early intervention services if delays noted
- Some seizure medications or underlying conditions may affect development

**Do not limit experiences unnecessarily:**

- Babies with seizure disorders can participate in typical activities with appropriate supervision
- Modify for safety but encourage development
- Discuss activity questions with neurologist

### Parent Self-Care

**Managing the emotional impact:** Fear, anxiety, hypervigilance, and exhaustion are normal responses to caring for a baby with seizures. Prioritize your well-being by accepting help from others, training reliable backup caregivers so you can take breaks, and connecting with support resources (Epilepsy Foundation support groups, online communities, professional counseling). Maintain your own health appointments and address your mental health needs—preparation and self-care enable you to provide optimal care for your baby.

### Sibling Considerations

**Support siblings** with age-appropriate explanations, honest answers to questions, and reassurance that it's not their fault. Include them in safe ways while maintaining their routines and giving individual attention. Watch for stress signs (behavior changes, regression, anxiety) and provide consistent reassurance that they are loved and that parents are managing baby's care.

## When to Escalate Care

### Call 911 Immediately

Seizure >5 minutes, multiple seizures without recovery, breathing difficulty, seizure in water, won't wake after seizure, first seizure ever, or rescue medication ineffective.

### Contact Neurologist Same Day

Changed seizure pattern, increasing frequency, new seizure type, cluster seizures, incomplete recovery between seizures, or concerning medication side effects.

### Contact Pediatrician

Fever, infection signs, vomiting/diarrhea affecting medication absorption, or routine well-child care. Coordinate by informing pediatrician of seizure changes and neurologist of illnesses.

**Trust your judgment—if something seems seriously wrong, seek immediate care.**
