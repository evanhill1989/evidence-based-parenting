2. **Seizure characteristics:**
   - Type of movements (jerking, stiffening, limp)
   - Body parts involved (one side, both sides, specific limbs)
   - Eye position (straight ahead, deviated, rolling, closed)
   - Level of awareness (responsive, unresponsive, partially aware)
   - Color changes (pale, blue, flushed)

3. **Before the seizure:**
   - Activity baby was doing
   - Possible triggers (missed sleep, illness, missed medication, fever)
   - Any warning signs or changes in behavior
   - Time since last medication dose

4. **After the seizure:**
   - Postictal state (sleepy, confused, weak)
   - Duration of recovery period
   - Any focal weakness or abnormal movements
   - Return to normal behavior

5. **Interventions:**
   - Rescue medication given (time, dose)

## Seizure Recognition Protocol

### Differentiating Seizures from Normal Movements

**Common normal movements that can be mistaken for seizures:**

**Benign sleep myoclonus:**
- ✓ Jerking during sleep only
- ✓ Stops immediately when baby wakes
- ✓ No eye involvement
- ✓ Very common in newborns

**Jitteriness:**
- ✓ Fine, rapid trembling
- ✓ Stops when you gently hold the limb
- ✓ Often triggered by stimulation or handling
- ✓ Common in newborns, especially if blood sugar issues

**Startle reflex (Moro reflex):**
- ✓ Sudden flinging arms out, then drawing in
- ✓ Triggered by loud noise or position change
- ✓ Brief, immediate
- ✓ Baby is aware and responsive
- ✓ Normal primitive reflex

**Shuddering attacks:**
- ✓ Rapid shivering/shuddering of head and shoulders
- ✓ Baby is fully awake and aware
- ✓ Lasts only seconds
- ✓ No loss of awareness
- ✓ Benign condition

### Seizure Characteristics Checklist

**More likely to be a seizure if:**

- [ ] Rhythmic, repetitive movements
- [ ] Doesn't stop when you touch or hold limb
- [ ] Eyes open with fixed gaze or deviation
- [ ] Baby is unresponsive or altered awareness
- [ ] Progresses or changes during episode
- [ ] Followed by period of sleepiness or confusion (postictal)
- [ ] Consistent pattern each time it happens
- [ ] Lasts longer than a few seconds
- [ ] Color change (pale, blue, flushed)
- [ ] Breathing changes

**More likely to be normal if:**

- [ ] Only during sleep or drowsiness
- [ ] Stops with gentle touch or repositioning
- [ ] Baby is awake and aware throughout
- [ ] Not rhythmic or stereotyped
- [ ] Very brief (1-2 seconds)
- [ ] Triggered by obvious external stimulus
- [ ] Inconsistent pattern

### Know Your Baby's Seizure Pattern

**If your baby has diagnosed epilepsy:**

1. **Learn the typical characteristics:**
   - How seizures usually start
   - Typical duration
   - Usual body parts involved
   - Expected postictal behavior

2. **Recognize variations:**
   - New seizure types may emerge
   - Seizures may change as baby grows
   - Report new or different seizure types to neurologist

3. **Identify concerning changes:**
   - Longer duration than usual
   - More frequent than usual
   - Different pattern or body parts involved
   - Incomplete recovery between seizures
   - New symptoms

### When in Doubt

**If you're unsure whether an event was a seizure:**

1. **Video the event if it happens again**
2. **Document detailed description**
3. **Call neurology office for guidance**
4. **Share video with medical team**

**Do not dismiss concerning movements** - Better to check with medical team than miss seizure activity requiring treatment adjustment.
