## Overview

Welcome to toddlerhood! Between 12 and 36 months, your child transforms from a baby into an independent little person. This stage brings walking, running, climbing, language explosion, and the emergence of personality and preferences.

As a pediatric neurology nurse practitioner, I see this stage as one of the most dramatic developmental periods. Your toddler's brain is making incredible connections, particularly in language and social-emotional development.

**What you'll find here:**

- Developmental milestones by age (12-18, 18-24, 24-36 months)
