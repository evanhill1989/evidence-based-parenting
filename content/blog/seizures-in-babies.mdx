## Introduction

Few things are more frightening for parents than witnessing their baby have a seizure. The sudden loss of control, abnormal movements, and altered consciousness can be terrifying—especially when you don't know what's happening or what to do.

As a pediatric neurology nurse practitioner, I evaluate babies and children with seizures every day. I understand both the medical complexity of seizure disorders and the profound fear and uncertainty parents experience. I've sat with countless families in the moments after a first seizure, answering the same crucial questions: What just happened? Why did this happen? Will it happen again? Is my baby okay?

This guide provides comprehensive, evidence-based information about seizures in babies. My goal is to help you:

- Understand what seizures are and why they happen
- Recognize different types of seizures in infants
- Know what to do during and after a seizure
- Understand when seizures are emergencies
- Learn about diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis
- Distinguish seizures from normal baby movements that can look concerning

**Important context:** While this guide is comprehensive, every baby is different. Seizures require medical evaluation. This information helps you understand and navigate the process, but it doesn't replace personalized medical care from your child's healthcare team.

Let's start with the fundamentals.

## What Is a Seizure?

### The Basics

**A seizure is abnormal electrical activity in the brain.** Think of it like an electrical storm—neurons (brain cells) that normally fire in coordinated patterns suddenly fire excessively and synchronously.

This abnormal electrical activity can cause:

- Changes in movement (stiffening, jerking, limpness)
- Changes in awareness or consciousness
- Changes in sensation, behavior, or autonomic functions (breathing, heart rate)

**Key point:** Seizures are a symptom, not a disease. They indicate that something is affecting normal brain function, but the underlying causes vary ranging from genetic to structural brain abnormalities and unknown causes. Parents often ask me what caused their child's seizure, but unfortunately, often we just don't know.

### How the Brain Normally Works

In a typical brain:

- Neurons communicate through carefully controlled electrical and chemical signals
- Excitatory signals tell neurons to "fire"
- Inhibitory signals tell neurons to "stop"
- This balance maintains organized brain activity

During a seizure, this balance is disrupted:

- Excessive excitation or insufficient inhibition
- Neurons fire too much, too fast, too synchronously
- Normal brain function is temporarily interrupted

## Types of Seizures in Babies

Seizures in infants can look very different from seizures in older children or adults. Here are the main types you should know about.

---

### Focal Seizures (Previously Called "Partial Seizures")

**What they are:** Seizures originating in one specific area of the brain

**What they look like:**

- Rhythmic jerking of one arm, leg, or side of face
- Head or eyes turning to one side
- Repetitive movements like lip smacking, chewing, or cycling of legs
- May or may not involve loss of awareness

**Duration:** Seconds to minutes

**What happens after:** Baby may be sleepy or confused, or may return immediately to normal

**Clinical Insight:**
In babies, focal seizures often show up as consistent, repetitive movements involving one limb, one side of the face, or a fixed eye deviation. What helps me differentiate them from normal newborn behaviors is the rhythmic, stereotyped nature of the movement—it looks the same from start to finish and doesn't stop when you reposition the baby. Awareness is trickier to assess in infants, but I look for behavioral arrest: the baby stops responding to voice, stops tracking, or has a clear pause in normal movement. Autonomic changes such as color change, apnea, or altered breathing also support seizure activity. These features, combined with video review and EEG correlation, help confirm focal onset.

---

### Infantile Spasms (May be associated with West Syndrome)

**What they are:** A specific seizure type usually beginning between 4–8 months, with the broader onset range at 3–12 months.

**What they look like:**

- Sudden flexion (bending forward) of head, trunk, and limbs—like a "jack-knife"
- Or sudden extension (straightening) of arms and legs
- Each spasm lasts 1-2 seconds
- **Occur in clusters**: Multiple spasms in a row (5-100 spasms in a cluster)
- Often happen when waking up or falling asleep

**Why they're concerning:**

- Associated with developmental regression
- Can indicate underlying brain abnormalities
- Require prompt treatment to prevent developmental harm
- Early treatment improves outcomes

**CRITICAL:** If you suspect infantile spasms, contact your pediatrician IMMEDIATELY. Don't wait. Video the episodes if possible.

**Clinical Insight:**
When I talk to parents about infantile spasms, I emphasize that outcomes vary widely and depend heavily on how quickly treatment begins and what the underlying cause is. The evaluation typically includes an urgent EEG (looking for hypsarrhythmia), brain MRI, and a metabolic/genetic workup. Treatment—usually ACTH, high-dose steroids, or vigabatrin—should start as soon as possible, ideally within days, because early control of spasms improves developmental outcomes. When spasms are treated promptly and the EEG normalizes, many children make meaningful developmental gains. Delayed treatment, ongoing spasms, genetic cause, or a severe underlying brain condition can lead to more significant long-term challenges. Early recognition truly changes the trajectory.

---

### Febrile Seizures

**What they are:** Seizures triggered by fever (see dedicated section below) #TODO - Make Link to section

**Age:** Typically 6 months - 5 years

**What they look like:**

- Usually generalized tonic-clonic, but can be focal
- Occur with rise in temperature (often early in illness)
- Usually brief (1-5 minutes)

---

### Neonatal Seizures (First 28 Days of Life)

**What they are:** Seizures in newborns, often with different appearance than seizures in older babies

**What they look like (often subtle):**

- Eye deviation or abnormal eye movements
- Cycling or pedaling leg movements
- Lip smacking, chewing, or tongue movements
- Brief stiffening
- Apnea (pauses in breathing)
- Color changes

**Why they're concerning:**

- Can indicate serious underlying conditions
- May be missed without continuous EEG monitoring
- Require immediate evaluation and treatment

---

### Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (Rare in Infants, Previously "Grand Mal")

**What they are:** Seizures involving both sides of the brain

**What they look like:**

- **Tonic phase** (10-30 seconds): Body stiffens, baby may cry out, may stop breathing briefly, may turn blue
- **Clonic phase** (1-2 minutes): Rhythmic jerking of arms and legs
- Loss of consciousness throughout

**Duration:** Usually 1-3 minutes

**What happens after:**

- **Postictal period**: Baby will be very sleepy, confused, may sleep for hours
- May have headache (if old enough to indicate)
- Gradually returns to baseline over minutes to hours

**More common in:**older children. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures can occur in infants, but classic, well-formed tonic-clonic patterns are less common in young babies than in older children. In infants, these seizures may appear less rhythmic or more subtle.

---

### Absence Seizures (Rare in Infants)

**What they are:** Brief lapses in awareness

**What they look like:**

- Sudden staring spell
- Stops mid-activity
- May have subtle eye fluttering or mouth movements
- Unresponsive to auditory or tactile stimulation
- Lasts 5-10 seconds
- Immediately returns to activity as if nothing happened

**Why they're hard to recognize:**

- Very brief
- No dramatic movements
- Easy to miss or attribute to "spacing out"

**More common in:** Older children (4-12 years), rare in babies. True absence seizures are extremely rare before age 3, and the staring episodes seen in infants are almost never absence epilepsy.

---

## Common Causes of Infant Seizures

Understanding why seizures happen helps with diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

### Febrile Seizures (Most Common)

**What they are:** Seizures triggered by fever

**Prevalence:** 2-5% of children have at least one febrile seizure

**Age:** Typically 6 months to 5 years (peak 12-18 months)

**Cause:** Rapid rise in temperature combined with a child’s genetic predisposition. Fever height alone does not predict seizure risk. Exact mechanism is not understood.

**Types:**

- **Simple febrile seizures** (90%):

  - Generalized (whole body)
  - Last less than 15 minutes
  - Don't recur within 24 hours
  - Child recovers quickly

- **Complex febrile seizures** (10%):
  - Focal (one side of body)
  - Last more than 15 minutes
  - Multiple seizures in 24 hours
  - Prolonged recovery

**Prognosis:**

- Usually benign
- About 30% have recurrence
- Small increased risk (2-7%) of developing epilepsy later
- Do not cause brain damage
- Most children outgrow them

**Treatment:**

- Usually don't require medication (for febrile seizures themselves)
- Treat underlying infection
- Fever control for comfort (doesn't prevent future febrile seizures)

**Clinical Insight:**
For a first-time febrile seizure, I focus on ruling out serious infection, especially in younger infants. If the child is over 6 months, otherwise healthy, returns quickly to baseline, and the seizure was a classic simple febrile seizure, extensive testing typically isn't needed. I reassure parents that these seizures are frightening but usually benign. I explain that about one in three children will have another febrile seizure in the future, especially if the first occurred early in childhood. I emphasize that febrile seizures do not cause brain damage or developmental problems.

---

### Infection

**Types:**

- **Meningitis**: Infection of membranes covering brain
- **Encephalitis**: Infection of brain tissue itself
- **Sepsis**: Bloodstream infection

**Why they cause seizures:** Direct irritation of brain tissue, inflammation, metabolic effects

**Other symptoms:**

- Fever
- Lethargy or extreme irritability
- Poor feeding
- Vomiting
- Rash (sometimes)
- Bulging fontanelle (soft spot)
- Stiff neck (if old enough to assess)

**Urgency:** HIGH - requires immediate evaluation and treatment

---

### Metabolic Problems

**Examples:**

- **Hypoglycemia** (low blood sugar)
- **Hypocalcemia** (low calcium)
- **Hyponatremia** (low sodium)
- **Inborn errors of metabolism**

**Why they cause seizures:** Brain depends on precise chemical balance; imbalances disrupt normal electrical activity

**When to suspect:**

- Newborn or young infant
- Poor feeding
- Lethargy or jitteriness (jitteriness can mimic seizures but is distinct; metabolic abnormalities can cause either)
- Family history of metabolic disorders

**Diagnosis:** Blood tests

**Treatment:** Correct the underlying metabolic problem

---

### Brain Malformations or Genetic Conditions

**Examples:**

- Cortical dysplasia (abnormal brain development)
- Tuberous sclerosis
- Other genetic syndromes

**Why they cause seizures:** Abnormal brain structure or function

**When to suspect:**

- Seizures starting in newborn period or early infancy
- Developmental delays
- Other physical findings
- Family history

**Diagnosis:** MRI, genetic testing

---

### Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury (Lack of Oxygen)

**Causes:**

- Birth complications
- Severe infection
- Near-drowning
- Other events causing oxygen deprivation

**Why they cause seizures:** Brain damage from lack of oxygen

**Timing:** Often occurs soon after the injury

**Prognosis:** Depends on severity and extent of injury

---

### Epilepsy

**What it is:** Tendency to have recurrent, unprovoked seizures

**Causes:**

- Sometimes brain abnormality or injury
- Often genetic
- Sometimes unknown (idiopathic)

**Diagnosis:** Requires at least 2 unprovoked seizures, or 1 seizure with an abnormal EEG

**Treatment:** Anti-epileptic medications, ketogenic diet, surgical interventions

---

### Other Causes

- **Trauma**: Head injury
- **Stroke**: Rare in babies but possible
- **Brain tumors**: Rare in infancy
- **Medication reactions or toxin exposure**
- **Withdrawal**: From medications baby was exposed to in utero

---

## What to Do During a Seizure

**If you witness your baby having a seizure:**

### Immediate Actions

1. **Stay calm** (I know this is hard, but it helps you help your baby)

2. **Time the seizure**

   - Look at clock and note start time
   - This information is crucial for medical team

3. **Keep baby safe**

   - Place on side if possible (recovery position)
   - Move away from dangerous objects
   - If in arms, gently lay down on safe surface
   - Do NOT restrain movements

4. **Protect the airway**

   - Turn to side to prevent choking on saliva
   - Do NOT put anything in baby's mouth
   - Do NOT try to hold tongue

5. **Observe and remember**

   - What movements happened?
   - What body parts were involved?
   - Did eyes deviate to one side?
   - Was baby responsive or unresponsive?
   - Any color changes?

6. **Video if possible**
   - If someone else is present, have them video
   - Don't prioritize video over safety
   - Video is incredibly helpful for diagnosis

### After the Seizure

1. **Place baby in recovery position** (on side)

2. **Check breathing** - should resume normally

3. **Stay with baby** during recovery

4. **Don't give food or drink** until fully awake

5. **Call for help** (see next section) #TODO

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't restrain the baby
- ❌ Don't put anything in baby's mouth
- ❌ Don't try to stop the movements
- ❌ Don't put baby in water
- ❌ Don't give medications during the seizure (EXCEPTION: If your child has been prescribed rescue medication such as rectal diazepam or intranasal midazolam, use only as directed by your neurology team)
- ❌ Don't leave baby alone

---

## When to Seek Emergency Care

### Call 911 Immediately If:

- **First seizure ever** (even if brief and resolved)
- **Seizure lasting more than 5 minutes**
- **Multiple seizures without regaining consciousness between them**
- **Difficulty breathing or turning blue**
- **Seizure in water** (risk of drowning)
- **Seizure with injury**
- **Baby won't wake up after seizure**
- **You're concerned this is a medical emergency**

### Go to ER or Call Pediatrician Immediately If:

- **First seizure in baby** (even if brief and baby seems recovered)
- **Baby under 6 months with any seizure**
- **Febrile seizure lasting more than 5 minutes**
- **Seizure with concerning symptoms** (stiff neck, rash, extreme lethargy)
- **Known seizure disorder** but seizure was different or longer than usual
- **Anything about the seizure concerns you**

### Call Pediatrician Same Day If:

- Known seizure disorder, typical seizure, but want to report it
- Seizure occurred but baby seems completely back to normal

**In general: First seizures and seizures in young babies always require immediate evaluation.**

---

## Diagnosis and Evaluation

**After a seizure, your baby will undergo evaluation to:**

1. Confirm it was a seizure
2. Determine the cause
3. Assess risk of recurrence
4. Guide treatment decisions

### History and Physical Exam

**Questions doctors will ask:**

- Exactly what happened? (description of event)
- How long did it last?
- What was baby doing before/during/after?
- Any triggers (fever, illness, injury)?
- Any family history of seizures?
- Developmental history
- Pregnancy and birth history

**Physical and neurological exam:**

- General health assessment
- Neurological examination
- Developmental assessment
- Looking for signs of infection or other underlying conditions

---

### Laboratory Tests

**Common tests:**

- **Blood glucose**: Check for hypoglycemia(as a cause) or hyperglycemia(as evidence seizure occured)
- **Electrolytes**: Check sodium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous
- **Complete blood count**: Look for infection
- **Blood culture**: If fever or infection suspected

**Sometimes needed:**

- Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): If meningitis or encephalitis suspected
- Metabolic testing: If inborn error of metabolism suspected
- Toxicology screen: If exposure suspected

---

### Electroencephalogram (EEG)

**What it is:** Test that measures brain's electrical activity

**How it works:**

- Small electrodes placed on scalp (doesn't hurt)
- Records brain waves
- Can take 30-60 minutes in an office visit; Inpatient studies can be longer
- May be done while baby sleeps

**What it shows:**

- Abnormal electrical activity
- Location of seizure focus
- Type of seizure disorder
- Risk of recurrence

**Limitations:**

- A normal EEG after a first unprovoked seizure lowers but does not eliminate recurrence risk.
- Captures only a snapshot of brain activity
- May need prolonged or video EEG monitoring

**Clinical Insight:**
I tell parents that an EEG is painless—just small stickers on the scalp—and most babies tolerate it well, especially if we coordinate it around their nap. The EEG helps us see if there is abnormal electrical activity that could suggest a risk for future seizures or help confirm a specific epilepsy syndrome. I also explain that an abnormal EEG does not automatically mean a child has epilepsy; it simply indicates the brain has a tendency toward seizures. Conversely, a normal EEG doesn't rule epilepsy out entirely. I go through the results with families in clear terms, focusing on what the findings mean for next steps and prognosis.

---

### Brain Imaging

**MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**

- Detailed pictures of brain structure
- Looks for abnormalities, malformations, injuries
- Preferred imaging after the acute period for comprehensive evaluation
- Requires baby to be very still (often needs sedation)
- No radiation

**CT Scan (Computed Tomography):**

- Quick imaging of brain
- Used primarily in emergency settings when concern for trauma, acute bleeding, or stroke
- Uses radiation (so reserved only for urgent clinical indications)
- Doesn't require sedation
- Less detailed than MRI for detecting subtle abnormalities

**Ultrasound:**

- Sometimes used in young infants (before fontanelle closes)
- Less detailed than MRI
- Quick and easy, no sedation needed

---

### When Testing Is Done

**Not all babies with seizures need all tests.** Decisions depend on:

- Age
- Type of seizure
- Clinical presentation
- Suspected cause

**For example:**

- Classic simple febrile seizure in healthy 18-month-old: May need no testing beyond ruling out serious infection
- First unprovoked seizure in 6-month-old: Likely needs EEG and possibly MRI
- Newborn with seizures: Extensive workup needed

---

## Treatment Options

Treatment depends on the cause, type, and frequency of seizures.

### Treating the Underlying Cause

**If seizure had a specific trigger:**

- Infection → Antibiotics
- Hypoglycemia → Correct blood sugar
- Electrolyte imbalance → Correct levels
- Fever → Treat infection (not usually preventing future febrile seizures)

**If underlying cause is treated, seizures may not recur.**

---

### Anti-Epileptic Medications

**When they're used:**

- Epilepsy (recurrent unprovoked seizures)
- Seizures due to brain injury or malformation
- Infantile spasms
- Sometimes after first seizure if EEG is abnormal

**How they work:**

- Reduce excessive brain electrical activity
- Different medications work through different mechanisms

**Common medications for babies:**

- Levetiracetam (Keppra) - preferred initial therapy outside the newborn period
- Phenobarbital - first-line in neonatal seizures (first 28 days of life)
- Valproic acid (Depakote) - used selectively in infancy when metabolic/mitochondrial disorders are ruled out
- Lacosamide (Vimpat) - typically used as 2nd or 3rd line option
- Vigabatrin (for infantile spasms)
- ACTH or steroids (for infantile spasms)
- Others depending on seizure type

**Important considerations:**

- Finding right medication and dose takes time and may require many adjustments
- May need to try different medications
- Regular blood tests may be needed
- Side effects vary by medication
- Never stop seizure medications suddenly

---

### Rescue Medications

**For babies with known seizure disorders:**

- Medication to stop prolonged seizures
- Dosed based on weight and age so not all babies will receive these
- Usually given rectally or less commonly in cheek
- Example: Diastat (rectal diazepam)
- Parents trained on when and how to use

---

### Other Treatments

**Ketogenic diet:**

- High-fat, low-carbohydrate diet to reduce glutamate levels and increase gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA)
- Can be effective for some seizure types
- Requires careful medical supervision
- Sometimes used when medications don't work

**Surgery:**

- Rarely used in babies
- May be option if seizures arise from specific brain area
- Requires extensive evaluation

**VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulator):**

- Device implanted to stimulate vagus nerve
- Can reduce seizure frequency
- Typically for older children, rarely babies

---

## Prognosis and Outlook

**The big question parents ask: "Will my baby be okay?"**

The answer depends on many factors:

### Febrile Seizures

**Prognosis: Excellent**

- Not considered epilepsy
- Don't cause brain damage
- Don't affect intelligence
- Most children outgrow them
- Small increased risk (2-7%) of epilepsy compared to general population

---

### Single Unprovoked Seizure

**Depends on:**

- Cause (if identified)
- EEG findings
- Brain imaging results

**In general:**

- About 50% will have another seizure
- If cause identified and treated, may not recur
- If EEG and MRI normal, good prognosis

---

### Epilepsy

**Highly variable depending on:**

- Specific epilepsy syndrome
- Response to medication
- Underlying cause

**Many children with epilepsy:**

- Achieve good seizure control with medication
- Develop and learn normally
- May outgrow seizures as brain matures

**Some forms are more challenging:**

- Infantile spasms: Can affect development if not treated quickly
- Some genetic epilepsies: May have ongoing seizures despite treatment
- Epilepsy from brain malformation: Depends on extent and location

---

### Development and Learning

**Many babies who have seizures develop completely normally.**

**Factors that affect development:**

- Underlying cause (brain malformation, genetic condition)
- Seizure type and control
- Medication effects
- How early treatment started (especially for infantile spasms)

**Not seizures themselves:** Brief seizures don't cause brain damage. It's the underlying condition (if any) that affects development.

---

## Living with a Seizure Disorder

**If your baby is diagnosed with epilepsy:**

### Medication Management

- Give medications exactly as prescribed
- Never skip doses
- Never stop suddenly (can trigger severe seizures)
- Refill before running out
- Know what to do if dose is vomited
- Regular follow-up with neurology

### Seizure Action Plan

- Know what your child's typical seizures look like
- Know when to use rescue medication
- Know when to call 911
- Share plan with caregivers

### Safety Considerations

- Supervised bath time (never leave alone)
- Safe sleep environment
- Avoid situations where seizure could cause injury (high places, bodies of water)
- As child grows, adapt safety measures

### Monitoring and Follow-Up

- Regular neurology appointments
- Periodic EEGs
- Blood tests as needed
- Developmental assessments

### School and Childcare

- Inform teachers/caregivers
- Provide seizure action plan
- Ensure medication access if needed
- Educate about seizure first aid

### Emotional Support

- Connect with other families (epilepsy support groups)
- Address your own emotional needs
- Sibling support if applicable
- Mental health support for parents if needed

---

## Seizures vs. Normal Movements

**Many normal infant movements can look alarming.** (See detailed [Quick Help guide on Seizures vs. Normal Movements](/quick-help/seizure-vs-normal-movements))

### Common Normal Movements Confused with Seizures:

**Benign sleep myoclonus:**

- Jerking during sleep only
- Stops immediately when baby wakes
- Very common in newborns

**Jitteriness:**

- Fine rapid trembling
- Stops when you gently hold the limb
- Common in newborns

**Startle reflex (Moro reflex):**

- Sudden flinging arms out
- Triggered by noise or position change
- Normal primitive reflex

**Shuddering attacks:**

- Rapid shivering/shuddering of head and shoulders
- Baby is fully awake and aware
- Lasts seconds
- Benign

### Key Differentiators:

**Likely normal if:**

- Eyes closed
- Stops when you touch or reposition baby
- Baby is awake and aware throughout
- Not rhythmic or repetitive
- Only during sleep or drowsy transitions

**More likely seizure if:**

- Eyes open
- Rhythmic, repetitive movements
- Doesn't stop with touch
- Baby unresponsive or altered awareness
- Progresses or changes character
- Followed by sleepiness or confusion

**When in doubt: Video and show to doctor.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can seizures cause brain damage?**

A: Brief seizures (lasting a few minutes) do not cause brain damage. However:

- Prolonged seizures (status epilepticus, lasting >30 minutes) can potentially cause harm
- The underlying condition causing seizures may affect brain function
- This is why seizures lasting >5 minutes are treated as emergencies

**Q: If my baby has one seizure, will they have epilepsy?**

A: Not necessarily. One seizure doesn't equal epilepsy. Epilepsy is diagnosed after:

- At least 2 unprovoked seizures, OR
- 1 seizure with abnormal EEG that shows high likelihood of recurrence

Many babies have a single seizure and never have another.

**Q: Are febrile seizures dangerous?**

A: Febrile seizures look frightening but are generally not dangerous. They:

- Don't cause brain damage
- Don't affect intelligence
- Don't usually last long enough to cause harm
- Are fairly common (2-5% of children)

However, first febrile seizure should be evaluated to ensure there's no serious underlying infection.

**Q: Can I prevent febrile seizures by controlling fever?**

A: Unfortunately, no. Febrile seizures occur with the rapid rise in temperature, often before you even know your child has a fever. Treating fever with medication makes your child more comfortable but doesn't prevent febrile seizures.

**Q: Will my child need medication forever?**

A: Not always. It depends on:

- The specific seizure disorder
- Seizure control
- EEG findings over time

Many children are able to discontinue medication after being seizure-free for 1-2 years (under doctor supervision). Some need lifelong treatment.

**Q: Can babies outgrow seizures?**

A: Some seizure types yes, others no:

- Febrile seizures: Almost always outgrown by age 5-6
- Some epilepsy syndromes: Resolve as brain matures
- Other epilepsies: May be lifelong

**Q: Should I wake my baby to check on them after a seizure?**

A: After a seizure, babies often sleep deeply (postictal sleep). This is normal and expected. You don't need to wake them, but you should:

- Check that they're breathing normally
- Leave in safe sleep position (On back with same safe sleep environment as recommended by AAP - [AAP Safe Sleep Recommendations](https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/safe-sleep))
- Monitor periodically

If you can't wake them at all, or they seem to have difficulty breathing, seek immediate help.

**Q: Can seizure medications cause side effects?**

A: Yes, all medications can have side effects. Common ones vary by medication but may include:

- Drowsiness
- Behavioral changes
- Appetite changes
- Rash (some medications)

Your neurologist will monitor for side effects and adjust treatment as needed. The benefits usually outweigh the risks, especially given that uncontrolled seizures carry their own risks.

**Q: What should I tell babysitters or daycare about my baby's seizures?**

A: Provide a written seizure action plan that includes:

- What your child's seizures look like
- What to do during a seizure
- When to use rescue medication (if applicable)
- When to call 911
- Your contact information and your child's neurologist's information

**Q: Can seizures happen during sleep?**

A: Yes, seizures can occur during sleep. Some epilepsy types are more likely to have seizures during sleep or upon waking. If you suspect nighttime seizures, discuss with your neurologist—may need prolonged EEG monitoring.
