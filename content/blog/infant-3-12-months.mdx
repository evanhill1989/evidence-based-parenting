## Overview

Welcome to the infant stage! Between 3 and 12 months, your baby undergoes remarkable changes. This is a period of rapid physical growth, emerging mobility, social awakening, and early communication.

As a pediatric neurology nurse practitioner, I want you to understand the incredible brain and body development happening during these months. This stage takes your baby from a relatively immobile newborn to a curious, mobile explorer who may be standing or even taking first steps.

**What you'll find here:**

- Key developmental milestones (3-6, 6-9, 9-12 months)
- Feeding progression and introducing solids
- Sleep pattern changes
- Motor development milestones
- Language and social development
- Common concerns and red flags

## 3-6 Months: Social Engagement & Movement

### What's Happening

Your baby is becoming much more social and interactive. Smiles, laughs, and coos make this stage incredibly rewarding. Motor skills are rapidly developing - rolling, reaching, and bringing objects to mouth.

### Key Milestones (3-6 Months)

**Gross Motor:**

- Rolls both directions
- Sits with support
- Bears weight on legs when supported
- Pushes up on arms during tummy time

**Fine Motor:**

- Reaches for and grasps objects
- Transfers toys hand to hand
- Brings objects to mouth

**Social/Communication:**

- Laughs out loud
- Responds to own name
- Babbles ("baba," "mama" - not yet meaningful)
- Recognizes familiar faces

## 6-9 Months: Sitting & Early Mobility

### What's Happening

Sitting independently frees up your baby's hands for exploration. Many babies begin crawling or finding alternative ways to move (scooting, army crawling). Object permanence emerges - your baby understands hidden objects still exist.

### Key Milestones (6-9 Months)

**Gross Motor:**

- Sits without support
- Gets into sitting position independently
- Begins crawling (or alternative mobility)
- Pulls to stand

**Fine Motor:**

- Pincer grasp emerging (thumb and finger)
- Bangs objects together
- Picks up small objects

**Social/Communication:**

- Responds to name consistently
- Stranger anxiety may emerge
- Points at objects
- Says "mama" or "dada" (may not be specific yet)

## 9-12 Months: Standing & First Words

### What's Happening

Your baby is becoming a toddler! Many babies pull to stand, cruise along furniture, and some take first independent steps. Language comprehension grows rapidly, and first meaningful words often emerge.

### Key Milestones (9-12 Months)

**Gross Motor:**

- Pulls to stand
- Cruises along furniture
- May walk with support or independently
- Stands alone briefly

**Fine Motor:**

- Refined pincer grasp
- Puts objects in/out of containers
- Points with index finger
- Beginning self-feeding

**Social/Communication:**

- Waves bye-bye
- Plays gesture games (peek-a-boo, pat-a-cake)
- Says 1-3 words meaningfully
- Understands simple commands ("come here," "give me")

## Feeding & Introducing Solids

**Starting solids (around 6 months):**

- Watch for readiness signs: sitting with support, good head control, interest in food
- Start with iron-rich foods
- One new food every 3-5 days
- Continue breast milk or formula as primary nutrition

**Progression:**

- 6-8 months: Purées and very soft mashed foods
- 8-10 months: Soft finger foods, thicker textures
- 10-12 months: Most family foods (soft, safe pieces)

---

<a name="sleep"></a>
## Sleep Patterns

**Typical sleep (3-12 months):**

- Total sleep: 12-16 hours per day
- Night sleep: 10-12 hours (with possible wakings)
- Naps: 2-3 naps, transitioning to 2 naps by 9-12 months

**Sleep regressions common at:**

- 4 months (developmental leap)
- 8-10 months (separation anxiety, new skills)

## Development Overview

**Normal variations:**

- Some babies crawl at 6 months, others at 10 months, some skip crawling
- Walking ranges from 9-18 months
- First words can appear anywhere from 10-16 months

**What to support:**

- Generous floor time for movement practice
- Responsive interaction and conversation
- Safe exploration opportunities
- Reading and singing daily

## When to Call the Doctor

**Red flags:**

- Not rolling by 6 months
- Can't sit without support by 10 months
- No babbling by 9 months
- No response to name by 9 months
