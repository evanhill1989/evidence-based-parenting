## 🚨 Call Your Doctor Immediately If:

- Your child has lost skills they previously had (**developmental regression**)
- Your baby shows no response to sounds or voices by **6 months**
- Your baby cannot support their head by **4 months**
- Your baby shows **persistent** stiffness or floppiness at any age  
  _(Added “persistent” because brief tone fluctuations can be normal in infants.)_
- Your baby consistently uses only one side of their body
- Your baby shows no social connection or eye contact by **6 months**  
  _(6 months is the accepted “concerning” threshold; you used this consistently.)_

## Quick Assessment Checklist

□ **Is my child making progress?**  
Even slow but steady progress is usually reassuring.

□ **Is this delay in one area or multiple areas?**  
A delay in a single domain may reflect normal variation; delays across multiple areas warrant evaluation.

□ **Does my child seem engaged and interested?**  
Curiosity, shared attention, and social connection are important developmental indicators.

□ **Is the delay significant?**  
A few weeks late is very different from being months behind age-expected skills.

□ **Am I comparing to adjusted age (if premature)?**  
Premature babies need age correction until **2 years**, and sometimes up to 3.

□ **Has my pediatrician screened development recently?**  
Formal, standardized screening is recommended at **9, 18, and 24 or 30 months**.

## What's Happening

As a pediatric neurology NP who evaluates developmental concerns daily, I understand the anxiety of wondering whether your child's development is on track. Here's what you need to know:

**Milestone ranges are wide.** “Typical” development spans months, not days. A baby may walk anywhere between **9–18 months** and be completely normal. Ages listed in apps or books reflect averages—not deadlines.

**Some delay is normal variation.** Children progress differently depending on temperament, environment, body type, and innate differences. A cautious baby may walk later. A baby focused on language may take longer with motor skills. This is often normal.

**But some delays need attention.** The key is recognizing patterns suggesting your child might benefit from evaluation or early intervention. This guide helps you sort that out.

## When It's Normal vs. When to Worry

### This is usually normal variation if:

- Your child is **2–4 weeks** behind on a single milestone but moving forward
- They’re ahead in some areas and behind in others (uneven development is common)
- They were premature and you’re not adjusting for corrected age
- They’ve recently been ill or had major routine changes (temporary plateaus)
- They’re meeting skills in other developmental domains
- Your pediatrician has recently screened and has no concerns

### Schedule a pediatrician visit if:

- Your child is **more than 2 months** behind expected milestones
- You notice delays across **multiple** developmental areas
- Your child isn’t making steady progress over several weeks
- You have persistent concerns even if you can’t pinpoint why
- Your child missed formal developmental screening at 9, 18, or 24–30 months
- Delays are getting worse rather than better
- Your child shows unusual movement patterns or muscle tone concerns

### Seek immediate evaluation if:

- **Loss of any previously acquired skills** (most critical red flag)
- No response to sounds or name by **9 months**
- Cannot sit without support by **10 months**
- No crawling or alternative mobility (rolling/scooting) by **14 months**
- Not walking by **18 months**
- No single words by **16–18 months**  
  _(Refined because AAP flags 16 months; parents won’t be misled if you keep 18.)_
- No two-word phrases by **24–27 months**  
  _(AAP flags 24 months; including 27 retains your range.)_
- No social engagement or eye contact at any age

**From my clinical practice:** When parents come to me with developmental concerns, I focus on three things: Is the child making forward progress? Are delays isolated or across domains? And most importantly—is there any regression? A child who is slow but progressing is very different from one losing skills. Regression always warrants immediate evaluation.

## Age-Specific Red Flags

### By 3 months:

- Can’t support head during tummy time
- Doesn't seem to notice their hands
- No social smile
- Doesn’t respond to loud sounds

### By 6 months:

- Cannot roll in either direction
- Doesn’t reach for objects
- No babbling sounds
- Persistent stiffness or floppiness
- No response to familiar voices

### By 9 months:

- Can’t sit without support
- No back-and-forth babbling (“ba-ba-ba”)
- Doesn’t respond to their name
- Shows no stranger awareness

### By 12 months:

- Not crawling or showing alternative mobility
- Can’t stand with support
- No gestures (pointing, waving, shaking head)
- No single words
- Doesn’t play interactive games (peek-a-boo)

### By 18 months:

- Not walking independently
- Says fewer than **6 words**
- Doesn’t point to show things
- Can't follow one-step directions
- No pretend play

### By 24 months:

- Doesn’t use 2-word phrases
- Vocabulary fewer than **50 words**
- Doesn’t imitate actions or words
- Can't follow two-step instructions
- No interest in other children

## What to Do If You're Concerned

**1. Document what you're seeing**

- Note which milestones your child has achieved and when
- Take videos of concerning behaviors
- Track any regression or loss of skills

**2. Schedule a pediatrician appointment**

- Don’t wait for the next routine visit
- Share specific observations, not general worry
- Ask about standardized developmental screening tools
- Request referrals for evaluation when appropriate

**3. Contact Early Intervention directly**

- In the U.S., you can call your state’s program without a referral
- Services cover birth–3 years
- Evaluation is typically free
- Early intervention significantly improves outcomes

**4. Trust your instinct**

- Parents often notice early signs before screening detects them
- “Wait and see” can be appropriate, but persistent worry deserves follow-up
- Evaluation does not mean something is wrong
- Many children evaluated are ultimately developing typically—that's okay too

**As a specialist, I always tell parents:** I’d rather evaluate 10 children who are developing typically than miss 1 who would benefit from early intervention.

## Understanding Corrected Age for Premature Babies

If your baby was born prematurely, you must adjust their age when comparing milestones:

**How to calculate corrected age:**

- Subtract weeks premature from their chronological age  
  _(e.g., 12-month-old born 8 weeks early → corrected age 10 months)_

**When to use corrected age:**

- Use corrected age until **2 years**, sometimes up to **3 years**
- Always mention prematurity when discussing development
- Former preemies may need closer monitoring

## The Importance of Early Intervention

If your child has developmental delays, early intervention can make a tremendous difference:

**Why early matters:**

- Rapid brain development in the first 3 years
- Skills build on each other; delays can compound
- Earlier support improves long-term outcomes
- Helps parents learn effective strategies at home

**What early intervention includes:**

- Physical therapy for motor delays
- Speech therapy for communication delays
- Occupational therapy for fine motor or sensory needs
- Developmental therapy for global delays
- Family support and coaching

**Cost and access:**

- Birth–3: Usually free through state Early Intervention
- Age 3+: Free services through school districts (IDEA Part B)
- Private therapy available through insurance or self-pay

## Key Takeaway

**Most developmental variation is normal, but persistent parental concern matters.** If you're worried, trust that instinct. Early evaluation and intervention make a real difference—and many evaluations provide reassuring results. Either outcome is valuable.
