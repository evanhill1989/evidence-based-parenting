## 🚨 Call Your Doctor Immediately

**When to seek urgent professional provider help:**

- Baby has a fever (temperature 100.4°F/38°C or higher in baby under 3 months)
- Crying is accompanied by difficulty breathing, blue lips, or choking
- Bulging fontanelle (soft spot), especially when baby is inconsolable
- Baby seems extremely weak, limp, or unresponsive
- Crying sounds abnormal (high-pitched, weak, or painful scream)
- Vomits forcefully (projectile vomiting)
- You notice anything else that seems seriously wrong
- You feel so frustrated that you might lose control or act unsafely

**Remember:** For babies under 3 months, fever always requires immediate medical attention. When in doubt, call your pediatrician.

## Quick Comfort Checklist

Try these in order—sometimes it takes running through the list multiple times:

□ **Hungry?**
Newborns eat every 1.5-3 hours. Newborn stomachs empty quickly—offering a feed is always reasonable, even if recently fed

□ **Diaper needs changing?**
Wet or soiled diaper can be uncomfortable

□ **Needs burping?**
Try burping even if baby doesn't seem gassy

□ **Too hot or cold?**
Feel baby's chest/back (not hands/feet). Most newborns are comfortable in 1 more layer than an adult in the same environment

□ **Needs comfort/closeness?**
Skin-to-skin, holding, rocking, gentle bouncing

□ **Overstimulated?**
Move to quiet, dimly lit space. Less stimulation, not more

□ **Tired?**
Overtired babies struggle to settle. Create calm environment for sleep

□ **Just needs to cry?**
Sometimes babies cry for no fixable reason. Holding them through it helps

## What's Happening

It's 2am. Your newborn has been crying for what feels like hours. You've fed, changed, burped, and rocked. Nothing helps. You're exhausted and worried something is seriously wrong.

**Here's the truth all new parents need to hear:** Newborn crying peaks between 2-6 weeks of age, with babies crying 2-3 hours per day on average. Some cry much more. Cry totals often increase week over week until about 6 weeks before gradually decreasing. This is normal, though it's absolutely exhausting.

As a pediatric NP, I want you to know: **Most inconsolable crying in young babies has no underlying medical problem.** Your baby isn't in pain (usually). You're not doing something wrong. This is normal newborn behavior, however challenging it feels.

That said, sometimes crying does indicate a problem that needs attention. This guide helps you differentiate normal (though distressing) crying from concerning patterns.

## Why Newborns Cry So Much

**Crying is communication.** Your baby can't tell you what they need, so crying is their universal signal. But interpreting the signal is hard, especially when:

- You're sleep-deprived and exhausted
- You're a new parent still learning your baby's cues
- Your baby's cries all sound the same at first
- Sometimes there's no clear reason for crying

Newborns' nervous systems are still immature, and crying is partly how they discharge tension from the day.

**The "Period of PURPLE Crying":**
This term describes typical newborn crying patterns:

- **P**eak of crying: 2-6 weeks, then gradually improves
- **U**npredictable: Crying and soothing happen for no clear reason
- **R**esistant to soothing: Sometimes nothing helps
- **P**ain-like face: Even when not in pain
- **L**ong lasting: Can continue for hours
- **E**vening crying: Often worse in late afternoon/evening

Understanding this is normal helps, even when it doesn't make the crying stop.

## The Checklist: What Does My Baby Need?

### 1. Food

**Most common reason for crying in newborns.**

- Newborns typically eat every 1.5-3 hours (sometimes more frequently)
- Growth spurts (around 2-3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months) mean cluster feeding
- Hunger cues: rooting, sucking on hands, lip smacking
- Even if it "hasn't been long enough," try feeding

**Breastfed babies:**

- May need to nurse more frequently than every 3 hours
- Can't overfeed at the breast
- During growth spurts, may nurse almost constantly
- Parents often confuse comfort sucking with hunger—both are valid needs

**Formula-fed babies:**

- Typically consume 1-3 ounces every 2-4 hours in the first month. The general guide is 2-2.5 ounces per pound of body weight per day, divided by the number of feeds.
- Typical volumes often increase rapidly in first 4–6 weeks
- May need more during growth spurts

### 2. Discomfort

**Check:**

- **Diaper:** Even slightly wet can bother some babies
- **Temperature:** Feel baby's chest/back (hands/feet are often cool even when baby is warm). One layer more than you're wearing is a good rule
- **Clothing:** Tags, tight elastic, scratchy fabric
- **Hair tourniquets:** Hair wrapped around finger, toe, or (in boys) penis—uncommon but important to check
- **Position:** Try different holding positions

### 3. Gas and Tummy Trouble

**Signs of gas:**

- Pulling legs up
- Arching back
- Passing gas
- Tense abdomen

**What helps:**

- Burp frequently during and after feeds
- Bicycle legs gently
- Tummy massage (clockwise circles)
- "Colic hold" (baby face-down on your forearm)
- Warm bath (water should be comfortably warm, not hot)

**Note:** Gas is common and rarely indicates a medical problem. Simethicone has limited evidence but is safe to try if recommended by your pediatrician.

### 4. Need for Sleep

**Overtiredness is real.** Most newborns can stay awake 45–60 minutes before needing sleep (some slightly longer by 2–3 months).

**Overtired signs:**

- Fussing/crying
- Rubbing eyes
- Jerky movements
- Staring into space (gone past tired to overtired)

**What helps:**

- Calm, dark, quiet environment
- Swaddling
- White noise
- Rocking or gentle movement
- Don't try to "wear them out"—overtired babies struggle more to sleep

### 5. Overstimulation

Newborns have limited capacity for stimulation. Too much can overwhelm their developing nervous system.

**Signs of overstimulation:**

- Turning away from faces
- Fussing during play
- Hiccups
- Crying that worsens with more interaction
- Crying that worsens the more you try to soothe (can be a sign of sensory overload)

**What helps:**

- Move to quiet, dimly lit space
- Reduce noise and activity
- Calm holding without trying to engage
- Sometimes babies just need boring

### 6. Need for Comfort and Closeness

Some babies simply need more physical contact. This is not "spoiling"—it's meeting a biological need.

**What helps:**

- Skin-to-skin contact
- Baby wearing
- Rocking, bouncing, swaying
- Gentle sounds (shushing, singing, humming)
- Pacifier (if breastfeeding is going well; evidence on exact timing is mixed)

**The "5 S's" (Dr. Harvey Karp):**

- **S**waddle
- **S**ide/stomach position (while holding—never for sleep)
- **S**hushing sounds
- **S**winging/swaying
- **S**ucking (pacifier, breast, bottle)

## When Crying Might Indicate a Problem

**Most crying is normal, but sometimes it signals something needing medical attention:**

### Illness

**Concerning signs:**

- Fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher)
- Extreme lethargy or difficulty waking
- Poor feeding
- Fewer wet diapers than usual
- Decreased tear production (dry eyes while crying) can indicate dehydration
- Vomiting (not just spit-up)
- Diarrhea
- Rash
- Different cry than usual (weak, high-pitched, painful scream)

**Action:** Call pediatrician same day, immediately if fever or severe symptoms

### Reflux

Reflux peaks at 1–4 months and is usually benign.

**Signs of reflux (common, often benign):**

- Spitting up frequently (often normal)
- Arching back during/after feeding
- Obvious discomfort after eating

**Signs of GERD (reflux causing problems):**

- Poor weight gain
- Refusal to eat
- Choking or difficulty breathing
- Blood in spit-up or stool

**Action:** Mention reflux at well visit. Call if severe symptoms or poor weight gain.

### Milk Protein Sensitivity

**Signs:**

- Visible blood or persistent mucus in stool
- Excessive fussiness, especially after eating
- Rash, eczema
- Vomiting

**Action:** Discuss with pediatrician. May need formula change or (if breastfeeding) maternal diet modification.

### Ear Infection

**Less common in newborns, but possible:**

- Pulling at ear (though ear pulling alone is not reliably a sign of ear infection in infants this young)
- Fever
- Inconsolable crying
- Poor feeding

**Action:** Call pediatrician for evaluation

### Intussusception (Rare but Serious)

**Signs:**

- Sudden, severe crying (pulling knees to chest)
- Vomiting
- Bloody or "currant jelly" stool
- Periods of apparent wellness between episodes

**Action:** Seek immediate emergency care

### Neurological Concerns

**Very rare, but see doctor if:**

- High-pitched, unusual cry (especially if accompanied by other concerning symptoms)
- Extreme stiffness or floppiness
- Seizure-like movements
- Bulging fontanel (soft spot).The fontanel may temporarily bulge when the baby is crying forcefully—this is usually normal. Call immediately if it remains bulging when baby is calm and upright.
- Extreme irritability with any touch or movement

**Action:** Seek immediate medical evaluation

## Colic: When Crying is the Diagnosis

**Colic definition (Rule of 3s):**

- Crying more than 3 hours per day
- More than 3 days per week
- For more than 3 weeks
- In an otherwise healthy, well-fed baby

**Peak:** 6 weeks of age
**Resolution:** Usually by 3-4 months

**What colic is:** A description of a crying pattern, not a disease. Cause is unknown.

**What doesn't cause colic:**

- Bad parenting
- Something you did wrong
- Permanent problem

**What might help (evidence is mixed):**

- The 5 S's
- Probiotics (ask pediatrician; Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 shows some benefit in breastfed infants)
- Reducing stimulation
- Taking turns with partner
- Accepting it will pass

**Note:** Elimination diets for breastfeeding parents are not routinely recommended unless symptoms strongly suggest allergy.

**Most important:** Colic is temporary. It WILL end.

## When You're at the End of Your Rope

**This is critical:** Crying can push parents to a dangerous breaking point.

**If you feel angry, frustrated, or at risk of harming your baby:**

1. **Put baby in safe place (crib, bassinet)**
2. **Leave the room**
3. **Take a break** (even 5-10 minutes)
4. **Call someone for support**
5. **Return when calmer**

**It's OKAY to let your baby cry safely in their crib while you take a break.** Stepping away is a responsible, protective choice—not neglect. This is safer than holding them when you're at your breaking point.

**Never shake a baby.** Shaking can cause permanent brain damage or death.

**Get help:**

- Call partner, family member, friend to take a turn
- Call your pediatrician or local nurse advice line (many insurance plans/pediatric offices have 24/7 triage)
- Call postpartum support hotline: 1-800-944-4773
- If in crisis: Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)

**You are not a bad parent for feeling overwhelmed.** This is one of the hardest phases of parenting.

## Survival Strategies

**For the crying:**

- Take it in shifts with partner/support person
- If possible, plan 1–2 predictable rest periods daily with partner or support person
- Use white noise (for baby and to muffle crying for you)
- Baby wear for hands-free soothing
- Go for walk/drive (change of environment helps everyone)
- Accept that sometimes nothing works

**For you:**

- Sleep when baby sleeps (really—chores can wait)
- Accept help from others
- Lower all non-essential standards
- Remember this phase is temporary
- Talk to other parents (you're not alone)

**What not to do:**

- Don't compare your baby to others
- Don't blame yourself
- Don't try every piece of advice you receive (be selective)
- Don't ignore your own mental health
