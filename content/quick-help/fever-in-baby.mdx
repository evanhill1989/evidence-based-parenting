## Quick Assessment Checklist

□ **How old is my baby?**
Age changes everything about fever urgency

□ **What is the temperature?**
Rectal temperature is most accurate for babies

□ **How long has baby had fever?**
Duration matters for determining cause

□ **Any other symptoms?**
Rash, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, ear pulling?

□ **How is baby acting?**
Playful when fever down vs. lethargic all the time—very different

□ **Is baby drinking fluids?**
Hydration is critical

□ **Recent vaccines?**
Low fever 24-48 hours after vaccines can be normal

## What's Happening

As a pediatric nurse practitioner, I need you to understand this critical fact: **Fever itself isn't dangerous—it doesn't cause brain damage or long-term harm. Fever is a symptom telling us the body is fighting something.**

However, **the underlying cause can be serious—especially in babies under 3 months**. This is why young baby fever is always taken seriously:

- Their immune systems are immature
- Serious infections can progress rapidly
- They can't show us specific symptoms
- We need to rule out serious bacterial infections

For older babies, fever is usually from a minor viral illness, but certain patterns or symptoms require medical attention.

**This guide helps you:**

- Know when fever is an emergency
- Understand when to call the doctor vs. monitor at home
- Learn how to make your baby comfortable
- Recognize concerning symptoms beyond just the temperature

## How to Take Your Baby's Temperature

**Most accurate for babies: Rectal temperature**

### How to Take Rectal Temperature

1. Use digital thermometer (not glass)
2. Clean tip with soap and water or rubbing alcohol
3. Apply small amount of petroleum jelly to tip
4. Lay baby on back or tummy across your lap
5. Insert thermometer 1/2 to 1 inch into rectum (stop if resistance)
6. Hold in place until thermometer beeps
7. Remove and read temperature
8. Clean thermometer with soap and water or alcohol

**Normal rectal temperature:** 97.9-100.4°F (36.6-38°C)
**Fever:** 100.4°F (38°C) or higher

### Other Methods (Less Accurate for Babies)

**Axillary (armpit):**

- Easy but least accurate
- Reads about 1 degree lower than rectal
- If shows fever, confirm with rectal temp

**Temporal artery (forehead):**

- Quick and non-invasive
- Not recommended for babies under 3 months (and may be unreliable even in older infants)
- Accuracy varies by manufacturer and technique

**Tympanic (ear):**

- Hard to position correctly in babies
- Not accurate before 6 months
- Earwax can affect reading

**DO NOT USE:**

- Glass mercury thermometers
- Pacifier thermometers (unreliable)
- Fever strips (unreliable)

**When calling doctor, always report method used and exact temperature.**

---

## Febrile Seizures

**What they are:** Seizures triggered by fever, occurring in 2-5% of children (usually 6 months - 5 years)

**What they look like:**

- Stiffening of body
- Rhythmic jerking of arms and legs
- Loss of consciousness
- May last 1-5 minutes

**What to do during seizure:**

1. Stay calm
2. Place baby on side on safe surface
3. Don't restrain or put anything in mouth
4. Time the seizure
5. Call 911 if seizure lasts more than 5 minutes or this is first seizure

**After seizure:**

- Baby will be sleepy/confused (normal)
- Call doctor immediately even if seizure stopped
- First febrile seizure should be evaluated same day

**Prognosis:**

- Usually benign (not harmful)
- About 30-35% chance of recurrence
- Most children outgrow them
- Don't cause brain damage or epilepsy

**Prevention:**

- Treating fever doesn't necessarily prevent febrile seizures
- Can happen as fever spikes, before you even know baby is sick

## How to Make Your Baby Comfortable

### Medication

**Important:** Fever medication is for comfort, not to normalize temperature. The goal is to help your baby feel better, not to bring the temperature back to normal.

**For babies 3+ months** (DO NOT give to babies under 3 months without doctor approval):

**Acetaminophen (Tylenol):**

- Dosing by weight (ask pharmacist or doctor for exact dose)
- Can give every 4-6 hours as needed
- Reduces fever and provides comfort

**Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin):**

- For babies 6+ months only
- Dosing by weight
- Can give every 6-8 hours as needed
- May work better for higher fevers

**NEVER give:**

- Aspirin to children (risk of Reye's syndrome)
- Adult medications
- More than recommended dose

**Medication tips:**

- Use syringe or medicine dropper for accurate dosing
- Dose by weight, not age
- Medicine brings fever down 1-2 degrees but may not normalize temperature
- May take 30-60 minutes to work
- If baby vomits within 20 minutes of dose, can give again

### Comfort Measures

**Fluids:**

- Offer frequently (breast, bottle, water if 6+ months)
- Small amounts often better than large amounts
- Popsicles or ice chips for older infants safely taking solids (typically 9+ months)

**Clothing:**

- Dress in light clothing
- One layer is sufficient
- Don't bundle up (traps heat)

**Room temperature:**

- Keep room comfortably cool
- Don't overheat the room

**Lukewarm bath:**

- Can provide comfort
- NOT cold bath (can cause shivering, raises temperature)
- Never use rubbing alcohol (dangerous)

**Rest:**

- Extra sleep is okay and helpful
- Don't force activity

### What NOT to Do

**Don't:**

- Bundle baby in heavy blankets to "sweat out" fever
- Give cold baths or ice baths
- Use rubbing alcohol on skin
- Wake sleeping baby to give fever medication
- Underdress in cold environment
- Force feeding (fluids more important)
- Alternate Tylenol and Advil (unless doctor specifically recommends)

## Common Causes of Fever in Babies

### Viral Infections (Most Common)

**Examples:**

- Cold viruses
- Flu
- Roseola
- Hand-foot-mouth disease
- Stomach viruses

**Typical pattern:**

- Fever for 2-3 days
- Other symptoms (runny nose, cough, vomiting, diarrhea)
- Baby may still be somewhat playful when fever down
- Usually improves on its own

**Treatment:** Supportive care (fluids, comfort, fever control)

---

### Bacterial Infections (Less Common but More Serious)

**Examples:**

- Ear infections
- Urinary tract infections (UTI)
- Pneumonia
- Meningitis (rare but serious)
- Strep throat (older children)

**Important about UTIs:** In babies under 12 months, UTIs often present with fever only and no urinary symptoms. The absence of painful urination doesn't rule out UTI in young babies.

**Typical pattern:**

- May have high fever
- Baby may look sicker
- Specific symptoms (ear pain, painful urination, difficulty breathing)—though UTIs in infants often have fever alone
- Needs antibiotic treatment

**Diagnosis:** Requires doctor evaluation

---

### Post-Vaccine Fever

**Common after:**

- DTaP vaccine
- PCV (pneumococcal) vaccine
- MMR vaccine (older babies)

**Typical pattern:**

- Low-grade fever (under 101°F usually)
- Occurs within 24-48 hours of vaccine
- Lasts 1-2 days
- Baby otherwise well

**What to do:**

- Give acetaminophen for comfort if needed
- Call if fever high (over 102°F), lasts more than 2 days, or baby looks sick

---

### Teething

**Important:** **Teething does NOT cause high fevers or other systemic symptoms**

**Teething does NOT cause:**

- Fever over 100.4°F
- Vomiting or diarrhea
- Significant illness symptoms

**Teething may cause:**

- Very slight temp elevation (99-100°F)
- Fussiness
- Drooling
- Gum discomfort

**If baby has fever 100.4°F+ and you think it's teething:**

- Assume it's NOT teething
- Look for other cause
- Call doctor if appropriate for age/symptoms

---

## When Fever Isn't Really Fever

**Situations that can falsely elevate temperature:**

- Just after bath
- Overdressed/overheated
- After vigorous play or crying
- Very warm room
- Just after eating or drinking hot liquid

**What to do:** Wait 15-30 minutes and recheck

**Situations that can lower temperature reading:**

- Just ate or drank cold liquid
- Crying with mouth open (if using oral thermometer)
- Axillary (armpit) temps can under-read, so an overheated baby may still appear to have "normal temp" with this method

---

## Monitoring at Home

**If doctor says to monitor at home:**

### Check and record every 2-4 hours:

- Temperature
- Fluid intake (wet diapers)
- Baby's behavior and activity level
- Other symptoms

### Watch for warning signs:

- Fever increases
- New symptoms develop
- Baby looks worse
- Not drinking fluids
- Very fussy or lethargic

### Call doctor back if:

- Fever lasts more than 3 days
- Fever goes away then returns
- Baby gets worse instead of better
- New concerning symptoms
- You're worried

**Trust your instinct:** You know your baby best.

---

## Special Situations

### Premature Babies

- Premature infants often follow corrected age for fever risk assessment
- Your pediatrician may give you a specific fever protocol based on your baby's individual history
- Follow that personalized guidance even if it differs from this general chart
- May have lower threshold for emergency care
- Discuss fever protocols with your pediatrician in advance

### Babies with Chronic Conditions

- Heart conditions, immune problems, chronic lung disease
- May need earlier intervention
- Follow specific guidance from your specialists

### Babies on Immunosuppressive Medications

- Fever is always concerning
- May not be able to fight infection normally
- Call doctor immediately

---

## Prevention

**While you can't prevent all fevers:**

**Keep up with vaccines:**

- Prevent serious infections like Hib, pneumococcal disease
- Flu vaccine annually (starting at 6 months)

**Hand hygiene:**

- Wash hands frequently
- Limit exposure to sick people when possible

**Good nutrition:**

- Breastfeeding provides antibodies
- Adequate nutrition supports immune system

**But remember:** Fever from common infections is normal part of childhood. Healthy immune systems need exposure to germs.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Age matters most**: Fever in baby under 3 months is ALWAYS urgent—call doctor immediately
- **Fever itself isn't dangerous**: It's a symptom, and it helps the body fight infection
- **How baby acts matters**: A baby who plays when fever is down is less concerning than one who's lethargic all the time
- **Rectal temperature is most accurate**: Use this method for babies
- **Stay hydrated**: More important than eating during fever
- **Don't fear fever**: Most fevers are from minor viral illnesses
- **Know the red flags**: Certain symptoms with fever need immediate attention
- **When in doubt, call**: Better to check than to wait too long
