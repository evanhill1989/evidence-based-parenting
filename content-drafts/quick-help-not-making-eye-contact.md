# Not Making Eye Contact

_Quick reference guide - 4 min read_

**Age range:** 0-24 months

---

## 🚨 Seek Evaluation If:

- No eye contact at all by 6 months
- Complete loss of previously established eye contact (regression)
- No response to social smiles or faces by 6 months
- No shared enjoyment or social reciprocity by 9 months
- Combined with other developmental concerns (no babbling, no gestures, significant delays)
- Your persistent concern that something is different about your child's social engagement

**Important:** Limited eye contact alone, especially in young infants, is often normal variation. It's the pattern and combination of signs that matter.

## Quick Assessment Checklist

□ **How old is my baby?**
Eye contact expectations change dramatically with age

□ **Does my baby look at my face at all?**
Brief glances count, especially in newborns

□ **Does my baby smile when I smile at them?**
Social smiling is as important as eye contact (appears 6-8 weeks)

□ **Does my baby respond to my voice?**
Turning toward voice shows social engagement

□ **Does my baby seem interested in people?**
Overall social interest matters more than sustained eye gaze

□ **Are there other concerning signs?**
Isolated limited eye contact is very different from multiple red flags

## What's Happening

As a pediatric neurology NP who evaluates developmental concerns including autism, I understand why parents worry about eye contact. It's often mentioned as an early autism sign, which leads to understandable anxiety when babies don't make "enough" eye contact.

Here's what you need to know: **Eye contact develops gradually and varies widely among typically developing infants.** Many babies with limited eye contact are developing completely normally. At the same time, persistent lack of eye contact combined with other signs can indicate developmental concerns worth evaluating.

The key is understanding what's typical for your baby's age, what's normal variation, and what patterns warrant professional assessment.

## Eye Contact Development by Age

### Newborn to 2 Months

**What's typical:**

- Brief glances at faces (seconds, not sustained gazing)
- Preference for looking at faces over objects
- May look more at hairline or mouth than eyes
- Eye contact improves when held 8-12 inches away (optimal newborn focus distance)
- More alert and interactive during quiet alert states

**What's normal variation:**

- Some newborns make very little direct eye contact
- May prefer looking at high-contrast patterns
- Easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation

**Red flags at this age:**

- Seems to look through people
- No preference for faces at all
- No response to any social interaction

---

### 2-4 Months

**What's typical:**

- Increasing eye contact, especially during feeding and play
- Social smiling emerges (6-8 weeks)
- Begins tracking faces as they move
- May hold gaze for several seconds
- Lights up when seeing familiar people

**What's normal variation:**

- Some babies are more serious and less smiley
- Eye contact may be briefer when overstimulated
- Individual temperament differences

**Red flags at this age:**

- No social smile by 3 months
- Doesn't seem to recognize familiar people
- No increase in eye contact from newborn period
- Doesn't respond to faces at all

---

### 4-6 Months

**What's typical:**

- Sustained eye contact during social interactions
- Mutual gaze during play and communication
- Clearly prefers looking at people over objects
- Shows excitement when seeing familiar faces
- Beginning joint attention (looking where you look)

**What's normal variation:**

- More interested in exploring objects (developmentally appropriate)
- Brief eye contact before looking away
- Shy with strangers but engaged with family

**Red flags at this age:**

- Minimal eye contact with anyone, including primary caregivers
- No response to social games (peek-a-boo)
- Seems more interested in objects than people consistently
- No shared enjoyment during interactions

---

### 6-12 Months

**What's typical:**

- Well-established eye contact with caregivers
- Uses eye contact to communicate (looks at you, then at desired object)
- Joint attention (follows your gaze, looks where you point)
- Social referencing (checks your face in new situations)
- May show stranger wariness (normal, not a red flag)

**What's normal variation:**

- Sometimes more focused on exploration than eye contact
- Variation in intensity and duration of eye gaze
- Cultural differences in eye contact norms

**Red flags at this age:**

- Consistently avoids eye contact with everyone
- No joint attention or social referencing
- Doesn't look at you to share interest or excitement
- Decreased eye contact from previous months (regression)

---

### 12-24 Months

**What's typical:**

- Consistent eye contact during communication
- Uses eye gaze to direct attention ("look at that!")
- Checks in with caregiver visually during play
- Responds to name with eye contact
- Shows objects to others with eye contact

**Red flags at this age:**

- Minimal eye contact during any interactions
- Doesn't respond to name by looking at speaker
- No pointing or showing with accompanying eye contact
- Regression in previously established eye contact

## Eye Contact vs. Social Engagement: What Matters More

**Here's critical context:** Eye contact is ONE indicator of social engagement, not the only one. Sometimes parents focus so much on eye contact they miss the bigger picture.

**Look at overall social engagement:**

- Does your baby smile in response to your smile?
- Do they enjoy interactive games (peek-a-boo, pat-a-cake)?
- Do they show excitement when seeing you?
- Do they seek comfort from you when upset?
- Do they notice when you leave the room?

A baby who makes limited direct eye contact but shows all these other signs of social engagement is very different from a baby who lacks eye contact AND shows little social interest overall.

## When Limited Eye Contact is Normal

### Temperament and Personality

Some babies and children naturally:

- Are more serious and less overtly social
- Are cautious and take time to warm up
- Process better with brief glances rather than sustained gaze
- Have introverted temperaments

This is personality, not pathology.

### Cultural Factors

Eye contact norms vary across cultures. In some cultures:

- Prolonged eye contact with adults is considered disrespectful
- Children are taught to lower gaze as a sign of respect
- Different patterns of social engagement are valued

If your family's cultural background involves different eye contact norms, your baby may naturally develop those patterns.

### Situational Factors

Eye contact varies with context:

- When tired, sick, or hungry: decreased social engagement
- When overstimulated: may look away to self-regulate
- When deeply focused on an activity: less eye contact
- With strangers vs. familiar people: appropriately varies

### Visual Issues

Sometimes limited eye contact relates to vision problems:

- Uncorrected vision impairment
- Cortical visual impairment
- Other eye conditions

If you suspect vision issues, see a pediatric ophthalmologist.

## When to Seek Evaluation

**Isolated limited eye contact with otherwise typical development:** Often normal variation, but mention to pediatrician at well visits

**Limited eye contact PLUS any of these signs warrant evaluation:**

### Communication Concerns:

- No babbling by 9 months
- No words by 16 months
- No two-word phrases by 24 months
- Loss of language skills at any age

### Social Concerns:

- No social smiling by 3 months
- Doesn't respond to name by 12 months
- No pointing, showing, or waving by 12 months
- No interest in other children by 18 months
- Doesn't notice when parents leave/return

### Behavioral Concerns:

- Repetitive behaviors (hand flapping, spinning, lining up toys)
- Extreme distress with minor changes in routine
- Unusual sensory responses (covering ears, seeking/avoiding certain textures)

### Developmental Delays:

- Motor delays
- Cognitive delays
- Multiple missed milestones across domains

### Regression:

- Loss of ANY previously acquired skills (social, language, motor)

**Regression always requires immediate evaluation, regardless of other factors.**

## The Autism Question

Many parents worry about autism when they notice limited eye contact. Here's balanced information:

**Limited eye contact CAN be an early autism sign, but:**

- Most babies with limited eye contact do NOT have autism
- Autism involves a constellation of signs, not just eye contact
- Diagnosis requires comprehensive evaluation, not just one symptom
- Many autistic children do make eye contact, just differently

**Autism screening occurs at:**

- 18 months (routine screening)
- 24 months (routine screening)
- Any age if concerns arise

**If you're concerned about autism specifically:**

- Complete the M-CHAT screening tool (available online, discuss with pediatrician)
- Request developmental evaluation
- Contact Early Intervention for assessment
- Earlier identification allows earlier support

**Important:** Even if a child has autism, early intervention significantly improves outcomes. Seeking evaluation isn't about labels—it's about getting support if needed.

## How to Support Eye Contact Development

**What helps (for all babies, not just those with concerns):**

### Face-to-Face Interaction

- Position yourself in baby's line of sight during play
- Hold baby at 8-12 inches distance (optimal for young infants)
- Make exaggerated facial expressions
- Narrate what you're doing
- Wait for baby to look before continuing interaction

### Follow Baby's Lead

- Notice what interests them, then join in
- Comment on what they're looking at
- Don't force or demand eye contact

### Engaging Social Games

- Peek-a-boo
- Pat-a-cake
- Singing songs with gestures
- Simple back-and-forth games

### Minimize Competing Stimulation

- Reduce background noise during interaction
- Put away distracting toys during social play
- Choose quiet alert times for face-to-face play

### Respond to Communication Attempts

- When baby looks at you, respond enthusiastically
- Follow their gaze and comment on what they see
- Create rewarding social interactions

**What doesn't help:**

- Forcing a baby to look at you
- Showing excessive anxiety about eye contact
- Constantly redirecting to your face
- Comparing to other babies

## What to Tell Your Pediatrician

**Be specific about your observations:**

- "She makes eye contact with me but not with strangers" is different from "She never makes eye contact with anyone"
- "He used to look at me but stopped" (regression) is very different from "He's always had brief eye contact"
- "She looks at me but not for very long" is different from "She seems to look through me"

**Share the full picture:**

- Overall social engagement
- Communication development
- Play skills
- Responses to name and social bids
- Any other developmental concerns

**Video can help:** Capture examples of social interactions showing how your baby engages

## Key Takeaways

- Eye contact develops gradually over the first year—newborns are very different from 12-month-olds
- Normal variation in eye contact is wide—some babies are naturally more intense, others more brief
- Overall social engagement matters more than eye contact alone
- Isolated limited eye contact with otherwise typical development is usually normal variation
- Limited eye contact PLUS other developmental concerns warrants evaluation
- Regression (loss of previously established eye contact) always requires immediate evaluation
- Cultural and temperamental factors influence eye contact patterns
- Early evaluation for persistent concerns allows for early support if needed
