# Your Newborn: 0-3 Months
*Complete guide to the first three months from a pediatric neurology NP*

**Age range:** Birth to 3 months (the "fourth trimester")

---

## Overview

Welcome to life with a newborn! The first three months are a period of dramatic change—for your baby and for you. Your newborn is adjusting to life outside the womb while their brain and body undergo rapid development.

As a pediatric neurology nurse practitioner, I want you to understand what's happening in your baby's developing brain and body during these crucial early months. This guide covers what to expect, what's normal (even when it seems concerning), and when to seek help.

**What you'll find here:**
- Developmental milestones month by month
- Feeding and sleep patterns
- Brain and physical development
- Common concerns and when to worry
- Activities to support development
- Checklist for well-baby visits

## Month 1: The Adjustment Period (0-4 Weeks)

### What's Happening This Month

**The "fourth trimester":** Your baby is adjusting to life outside the womb. Everything is new—breathing air, processing sensory input, regulating temperature, digesting food.

**Brain development:** Your newborn's brain is forming up to 1 million new neural connections per second. The lower brain regions (brainstem) are functioning, but the cortex (thinking brain) is still quite immature.

**Physical changes:**
- May lose up to 10% of birth weight in first week (regains by 2 weeks)
- Umbilical cord stump falls off (1-3 weeks)
- Newborn acne may appear
- Jaundice common in first week

### Developmental Milestones: Month 1

**Gross Motor:**
- Reflexive movements (not yet intentional)
- Lifts head briefly during tummy time
- Strong primitive reflexes (Moro, rooting, sucking, grasp)

**Fine Motor:**
- Hands mostly fisted
- Reflexive grasp when palm touched
- Brings hands near face

**Vision:**
- Can see 8-12 inches (perfect distance for seeing your face during feeding)
- Prefers high contrast patterns and faces
- Tracks objects briefly

**Hearing:**
- Startles to loud sounds
- Calms to familiar voices
- Prefers human voice over other sounds

**Social/Communication:**
- Beginning to make brief eye contact
- Quiets when picked up or spoken to
- Cries to communicate needs (hunger, discomfort, overstimulation)

### What's Normal This Month

**Crying:** 2-3 hours per day on average (some babies much more)
**Sleep:** 14-17 hours per day in short stretches (2-4 hours at a time)
**Feeding:** Every 1.5-3 hours (8-12 times per day)
**Diapering:** 6-8+ wet diapers and 3-4+ dirty diapers per day after day 4

### Common Worries (That Are Usually Normal)

- **Constant sleeping or cluster feeding** - Both normal in first weeks
- **Hiccups** - Very common, not bothersome to baby
- **Sneezing** - Normal reflex, not necessarily a cold
- **Noisy breathing** - Often normal; newborns are nasal breathers
- **Jerky movements and tremors** - Immature nervous system
- **Crossed eyes occasionally** - Vision is still developing
- **Irregular breathing pattern** - Periodic breathing is normal

## Month 2: Emerging Awareness (4-8 Weeks)

### What's Happening This Month

**Big milestone this month:** Social smiling! Around 6-8 weeks, you'll see your baby's first real social smile—a response to your face or voice, not just gas.

**Brain development:** Visual cortex rapidly maturing. Social processing networks coming online. Your baby is becoming more aware of and interested in the world.

**Physical changes:**

## Month 3: Social Awakening (8-12 Weeks)

### What's Happening This Month

**Your baby is "waking up"** to the world. More alert, more social, more interactive. This is when parenting often becomes more rewarding—you're getting smiles, coos, and real interaction!
