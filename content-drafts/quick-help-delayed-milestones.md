# Delayed Milestones: When to Worry

_Quick reference guide - 3 min read_

**Age range:** 0-24 months

---

## 🚨 Call Your Doctor Immediately If:

- Your child has lost skills they previously had (regression)
- Your baby shows no response to sounds or voices by 6 months
- Your baby cannot support their head by 4 months
- Your baby shows extreme stiffness or floppiness at any age
- Your baby consistently uses only one side of their body
- Your baby shows no social connection or eye contact by 6 months

## Quick Assessment Checklist

□ **Is my child making progress?**
Even if slow, steady forward progress is usually reassuring

□ **Is this delay in one area or multiple areas?**
One delayed skill is often normal variation; multiple delays need evaluation

□ **Does my child seem engaged and interested?**
Curiosity and social connection are important developmental signs

□ **Is the delay significant?**
A few weeks late is different from months behind age-appropriate milestones

□ **Am I comparing to adjusted age (if premature)?**
Premature babies need age correction, typically until age 2-3

□ **Has my pediatrician screened development recently?**
Formal screening at 9, 18, and 24-30 months is recommended

## What's Happening

As a pediatric neurology NP who evaluates developmental concerns daily, I understand the anxiety of wondering whether your child's development is on track. Here's what you need to know:

**Milestone ranges are wide.** What many parents don't realize is that "typical" development spans months, not days. A baby might walk anywhere from 9 to 18 months and still be developing normally. The milestone ages you see in apps and books are averages—50% of children reach them earlier, and 50% reach them later.

**Some delay is normal variation.** Children develop at different rates based on temperament, environment, body type, and individual differences. A cautious baby might take longer to walk. A baby focused on language might progress more slowly with motor skills. This is often completely normal.

**But some delays need attention.** The key is recognizing patterns that indicate a child might benefit from evaluation and early intervention. That's what this guide will help you identify.

## When It's Normal vs. When to Worry

### This is usually normal variation if:

- Your child is 2-4 weeks behind on a single milestone but progressing
- They're ahead in some areas and behind in others (uneven development)
- They were premature and you're not correcting for adjusted age
- They've recently been ill or experienced major changes (temporary regression)
- They're meeting milestones in other developmental domains
- Your pediatrician has recently screened and isn't concerned

### Schedule a pediatrician visit if:

- Your child is more than 2 months behind expected milestones
- You notice delays across multiple developmental areas
- Your child isn't making steady progress over several weeks
- You have persistent concerns even if you can't pinpoint exactly why
- Your child missed formal developmental screening at 9, 18, or 24 months
- Delays are getting worse rather than better
- Your child shows unusual movement patterns or muscle tone

### Seek immediate evaluation if:

- **Loss of any previously acquired skills** (most important red flag)
- No response to sounds or name by 9 months
- Cannot sit without support by 10 months
- No crawling or alternative mobility by 14 months
- Not walking by 18 months
- No single words by 18 months
- No two-word phrases by 27 months
- No social engagement or eye contact at any age

**From my clinical practice:** When parents come to me concerned about development, I look at three things: Is the child making progress (even if slow)? Are delays isolated or across multiple domains? And most critically—is there any regression? A child who's developing slowly but steadily forward is very different from one who's losing skills. Regression always warrants immediate evaluation.

## Age-Specific Red Flags

### By 3 months:

- Can't support head during tummy time
- Doesn't seem to notice their hands
- No social smile
- Doesn't respond to loud sounds

### By 6 months:

- Cannot roll in either direction
- Doesn't reach for objects
- No babbling sounds
- Seems very stiff or very floppy
- No response to familiar voices

### By 9 months:

- Can't sit without support
- No back-and-forth babbling ("ba-ba-ba")
- Doesn't respond to their name
- Shows no stranger awareness

### By 12 months:

- Not crawling or showing alternative mobility (scooting, rolling)
- Can't stand with support
- No gestures (pointing, waving, shaking head)
- No single words
- Doesn't play interactive games (peek-a-boo)

### By 18 months:

- Not walking independently
- Says fewer than 6 words
- Doesn't point to show things to others
- Can't follow simple one-step directions
- Shows no pretend play

### By 24 months:

- Doesn't use 2-word phrases
- Vocabulary fewer than 50 words
- Doesn't imitate actions or words
- Can't follow two-step instructions
- No interest in other children

## What to Do If You're Concerned

**1. Document what you're seeing**

- Keep notes on what milestones your child has achieved and when
- Video examples of your concerns to show your pediatrician
- Track any regression or loss of skills

**2. Schedule a pediatrician appointment**

- Don't wait for the next well-visit if you're concerned
- Share your specific observations, not just general worry
- Ask about formal developmental screening tools
- Request referral for evaluation if needed

**3. Contact Early Intervention directly**

- In the US, you can call your state's Early Intervention program without a referral
- Services are available for children birth to 3 years with delays
- Evaluation is typically free
- Early intervention significantly improves outcomes

**4. Trust your instinct**

- Parents often notice concerns before formal screening catches them
- "Wait and see" is sometimes appropriate, but persistent worry deserves investigation
- Seeking evaluation doesn't mean something is definitely wrong
- Many children evaluated are found to be developing typically—that's okay too

**As a specialist, I always tell parents:** I'd rather evaluate 10 children who turn out to be developing normally than miss one child who would benefit from early intervention. If you're persistently worried, that's reason enough to seek evaluation.

## Understanding Corrected Age for Premature Babies

If your baby was born prematurely, you need to adjust their age when comparing to milestones:

**How to calculate corrected age:**

- Subtract the number of weeks premature from your baby's chronological age
- Example: A 12-month-old born 8 weeks early has a corrected age of 10.5 months

**When to use corrected age:**

- Use corrected age for milestone comparisons until age 2-3 years
- Always mention prematurity when discussing development with healthcare providers
- Former preemies may need closer developmental monitoring

## The Importance of Early Intervention

If your child is found to have developmental delays, early intervention makes a tremendous difference:

**Why early matters:**

- Brain plasticity is highest in first 3 years of life
- Skills build on each other—early delays can compound
- Earlier intervention leads to better long-term outcomes
- Support helps both child and family

**What early intervention includes:**

- Physical therapy for motor delays
- Speech therapy for communication delays
- Occupational therapy for fine motor and sensory concerns
- Developmental therapy for overall delays
- Family support and education

**Cost and access:**

- Children under 3: Often free through state Early Intervention programs
- Children 3+: Free services through school districts (IDEA)
- Private therapy also available through insurance or out-of-pocket

## Key Takeaway

**Most developmental variation is normal, but your parental concern matters.** If you're persistently worried about your child's development, trust that instinct and seek evaluation. Early identification and intervention make a real difference, and many evaluations provide reassurance that development is on track. Either outcome is valuable.
